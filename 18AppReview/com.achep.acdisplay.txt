com.achep.acdisplay#150003:	  After so many days of successful use of this app i found that when you click Home button it unlocks just like an app after all this app is best. Please solve this issue. Thank you. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150007:	  It's as good as it could be. But still not perfect. Screen don't light up during incoming WhatsApp calls & my fingerprint sensor don't work. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150008:	  After installing this app fingerprint sensor doesn't work. Need to enter the pin manually to unlock the device 
com.achep.acdisplay#150023:	  It have been months since I last write my review and I'm still unable to uninstall the app on my Note 5. It keeps crashing everytime I try to deactivate the app on the device administration . I hope you gonna try and fix this problem instead of ignoring it . 
com.achep.acdisplay#150028:	  I love the app, it works smooth on my s7 and helps a lot with notifications. The only issue i have is when I try to unlock my phone, it opens the ac display, then after I swipe it goes to my lock screen before ac, and tells me I can't use my fingerprint to unlock my phone. I don't know why but if that gets fixed it is definitely a 5 star app. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150029:	  I like it a lot but im having an issue to where my original lock screen will show then the lock screen that I chose through this app will pop up. I see my original like screen for a quick second then the acdisplay will show. And it happens every time I lock my phone then hit my power key to light the screen up. Please let me know if I'm doing something wrong or is this is happening to anymore that has rated this app. And a fix for it because I want to use the app but it there isn't a fix for it I'm doing this delete it. Thanks. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150033:	  The s7 Edge is the second device I've had ACdisplay as my main lock screen. Only issue I've come across is recently, when I have a notification and I click the icon, it won't give me any information of the notification in place of the widget anymore. If somebody can tell me what to do to sort that out, I'll rate 5 stars. As of now, it's the only nice looking lock screen worth having. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150046:	  Great app for minimilistic lockscreen for any android lovers but now I am faced with an issue that I can't uninstall the app due to administration permission the settings app crashes all the time i try to deactivate the admin for the app 
com.achep.acdisplay#150047:	  Its very good but the problem is it rotates all the time. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150052:	  It's cool, but I need some help, I'm using asus zenfone5, I'm not quite understand how to replace the lock screen display system with acdisplay lockscreen., because I already following the instruction and it's still not working., The second problem is, it will "Locked" with Acdisplay whenever a new notification come up. So I had no choice to disable it, and just waiting till it fixed. I know it's still beta, and I will look forward when you fix it, thank you in advance., p.s.: Maybe it just me that missing some step but I don't know. Need help. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150060:	  Doesn't work. Android 6.0 on moto x play. Do I need root to use this? 
com.achep.acdisplay#150065:	  Can't remove from phone. When trying to remove it from administration, settings app stops working. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150069:	  Cool in theory, doesn't work consistently. Uninstalled 
com.achep.acdisplay#150085:	  Beautiful app with simplicity in mind however it stopped working when I locked my device and turned it again after some tries. Sad. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150095:	  This app is awesome, but without a passcode, i can't use it... please add pascode option, or pattern, any security method would make it useful 
com.achep.acdisplay#150096:	  tried to use as a lock screen. couldn't get back into my phone afterwards. nothing I did helped. had to restart the phone to gain access to it. And the app refuses to release its administration privileges for me to uninstall. do not install.

com.achep.acdisplay#150126:	  These many no. Of updates from the last 8 months and not the problem of having a security as been completed. Try adding that one too. The app would be a lot more awesome.

com.achep.acdisplay#150133:	  Sucks, it don't work plus I can't Uninstall it wtf 
com.achep.acdisplay#150139:	  This app has security issues with Note 5 
com.achep.acdisplay#150141:	  I love this app from the very first day of using it. Its very easy to access to the notifications from the lock screen. Love the compact look its having. But there is a tiny bit of problem that stops me from giving a 5star. On the lock screen if any additional notifications pop up while the screen is turned on, I cant access it from the lock screen itself. I have turn my screen off and on it inorder to access it from there.... So please... fix it so that I can happily rate u with a 5 star. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150143:	  Everything is nice but the home button issue that have other users too and a pincode that's missing too 
com.achep.acdisplay#150153:	  Backlight always on seem not working. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150157:	  There's no option to uninstall this app. For uninstalling, i have to uncheck it in device administrator, but when I click on it, the settings app crashes. So now i cannot uncheck it, means there's no way to uninstall this app. So I'm stuck with this app for life!  Guys please do not install this app, it's complicated useless and you cannot delete it afterwards... 
com.achep.acdisplay#150165:	  It is so great but.. Please fix the bugs. I can not turn it on when I need it . I want it to be always on but I do not know how. Plz reply my. Thx for the amazing app.

com.achep.acdisplay#150190:	   The app is a v good concept but it crashed too many times and requires restart. Requires bug fixes 
com.achep.acdisplay#150196:	   I can't uninstall without deactivating the app in device admin. When I go to deactivate it crashes my system settings. Very irritating. Nexus 5 running stock OS on latest build. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150197:	  Unable to install because settings crashes while disabling admin access. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150213:	   I emailed you guys about this issue. Every time I try to remove this app as a device admin it crashes my settings. Please resolve this issue because it is putting a bad name on your app.

com.achep.acdisplay#150219:	  Don't work 
com.achep.acdisplay#150220:	   Smashing minimalistic design. One note: I would love to use it on my tablet as well, but it seems that it won't autorotate. Perhaps this is a local problem, but it would be nice to see that implemented. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150222:	   Great app! However one major issue for me is that if ambient display is on and I take my phone out of my pocket, acdisplay does not show the currently playing music track. Instead, it shows the normal clock. Please fix this issue. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150228:	   Undoubtedly the best but there is a problem where missed call alerts don't show up in the lock screen when I get a missed call on honor 4x. Please help !! 
com.achep.acdisplay#150229:	   I really like this lock screen. It's the only one that I've seen that I actually want to use. The only problem I have with it is that it doesn't disable the home key before you unlock your device. After I hit my home key and I lock and unlock my device again, the lock screen doesn't appear for a moment. Allowing me to access my home screen and/or any app that I already had open. I don't know if this problem is able to be fixed without root, but if it is then I'd like to see this fixed in a future update. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150232:	   I cant delete the app! It wont even let me clear data. The app is usefull, but I was just trying it out! There was a bug, so I wanted to delete it. Thanks alot. There goes 100mb that I wont get back

com.achep.acdisplay#150238:	  Causes problems on rooted device. Stops working soon as i close the app 
com.achep.acdisplay#150239:	   I wish there was a security feature. Some bugs include: when using quick reply app (by jawomo), the notification symbol is a caution sign ( only happened after I updated to marshmallow) and after you turn the screen off, it flashes back on for a moment. Otherwise, this app is awesome. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150244:	   Do download it for it will make you feel great. Always works never fails, along with many features. Best app for notifications. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150250:	   When phone is turned off by using "double tap screen off" can only be unlocked using pattern or code. In other words, it won't unlock by fingerprints after double tap screen off in ac display! Please fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#150251:	   When I go to device administrator to deactivate it crashes my settings. I can easily deactivate any other app. But as soon as I hit the switch of this app it crashes instantly . HELP 
com.achep.acdisplay#150256:	   I have a problem adding widgets. Crashes Android settings on my G4 update : App won't uninstall because it's a device administrator but it crashes Android settings.

com.achep.acdisplay#150266:	  How can I delete this app... this is not working in.my device nor getting uninstalled. Please help. Me 
com.achep.acdisplay#150269:	   First thing its that you have to make it you device admin ( it will have access to everything on your phone, hard to uninstal). Second, it's not working 
com.achep.acdisplay#150270:	   Hey, ac display is a superb app but i am facing a issue with wake up screen feature, when ever i keep the phone screen facing ground and I lift the phone screen is nt waking up,, my proximity sensor is working fine,, out of 10 trails in 5 screen is waking up...so guys please fix asap.... 
com.achep.acdisplay#150271:	   I can't uninstall this app, and every time i try to uncheck from administrative permission it fails dose not want to leave me phone. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150279:	  I can't active the app .... It requires some permission. Already give administrator permission but it won't works.. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150282:	   But eats lot of battery on S6 Marsmallow. Please fix and it'll be 5 stars again 
com.achep.acdisplay#150288:	   Proximity sensor will not working while making calls and received calls 
com.achep.acdisplay#150289:	   Lock screen option and the notification feature is great and smooth too.. if you guys provide the security options like code/pattern unlock, you can replace the lock screen option which comes inbuilt can be replaced.. because not all the phones come with good lock screen options ;) No update to the app for a long time.. there are some irksome bugs to be fixed. Hence reduced the rating 
com.achep.acdisplay#150294:	   fix that i don't want the wallpapers will be same as my homescreen wallpaper i like this Ac lockscreen will have his own wallpaper set hope for the nxt update that will be available in this application. keep it up more power 
com.achep.acdisplay#150304:	   The app workers flawlessly for the past many months that I have been using it,, but nowadays don't know why but the app keeps crashing... AcDisplay is not responding??? EDIT : The error was with my phone and other apps were crashing as well... The error was that i had a virus downloaded accidentally that slowed the entire device and made other apps to crash... 
com.achep.acdisplay#150306:	   It does not seem to work on Moto x Pure even though I have the sensors. Edit: It does work with my phone but you must hit it for it to actually turn on. So it can be fixed 
com.achep.acdisplay#150316:	  Good bur a few bugs & Please add security options 
com.achep.acdisplay#150321:	   Do i have to disable the default security thumbmark feature? I have mails coming but its not working. And if it does, can it stays in the screen all the time? Pls show us video how to work it properly. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150322:	  This is probably one of my favorite apps of all time, but is the developer ever going to update it? Will he ever fix the stabilty issues? 
com.achep.acdisplay#150324:	   Everytime a notification comes in when my screen is on, acdisplay keeps activating (i.e. the acdisplay lock screen shows up). Please fix this bug as the notifications come in when I perform urgent tasks. Thank you. P.s. also, when I wave my hand over the proximity sensor even by accident while the screen is on, the app goes straight to the lockscreen. I'm genuinely "pissed" by this annoyance. My videos stop playing, my presentations screw up, all because the lockscreen activates. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150328:	   Loved the app but on my Samsung j2 when I press home button it shut down the app please fix it and add some pattern or pin lock to it otherwise awesome app. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150338:	   Bien Se han arreglado los bugs me gusta ^^ 
com.achep.acdisplay#150357:	   The app is awesome, only issue is it conflicts with fingerprint!! Everyone my note 5 asks for password and deactivates fingerprint unlock mode. Please fix I had to disable acdisplay until it is fixed. Thanks 
com.achep.acdisplay#150360:	   Nice app works very good on Galaxy note edge, just a bug, that it keeps on displaying same notifications again and again until you do not manually "Clear All" from notification bar. Hope it will be tuned in next update. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150363:	   Ive been using ac display on my OPO for over a year and have had no major issues. Currently running it on a s7 edge and have noticed a reoccurring issue. After my alarms trigger and go off, ac display does not function properly on the lockscreen. It no longer appears on my lockscreen. So far the only solution for me has been to either restart the device or toggle the on/off button in the ac display app settings. Please advise if anyone has insight, thanks! 
com.achep.acdisplay#150365:	  Sucks. I can't get rid of it now. What a pain in the @$$ 
com.achep.acdisplay#150366:	   Having one problem of using fingerprint sensor 
com.achep.acdisplay#150372:	   It won't work I enabled it and everything else but it didn't work please help 
com.achep.acdisplay#150380:	   I love this app, it does what it says it will and it looks amazing. The only problem I have noticed so far is the app bugs and doesn't appear when you clear your notifications on the lock screen, but not in the notification panel. Other than that it is awesome. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150382:	  Doesn't work with Android Marshmallow 
com.achep.acdisplay#150388:	   Please help keeps crashing won't let me remove 
com.achep.acdisplay#150402:	  Awesome. But as said it does not work well with stock fingerprint lock. Rest beautiful... 
com.achep.acdisplay#150405:	   It's a great app and I've been using for a few days now, but sadly, whatsapp stopped working. Please fix it. And also make it keep blinking the screen, and not only turn the screen on once. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150407:	   I have trouble with removing this app please fix. I need to deactivate it first, but when I want to deactivate it from settings&gt;lock screen and security&gt;device administrators&gt;Ac display, it always crashes. I already tried restarting my phone (Samsung S7) 
com.achep.acdisplay#150408:	   I wanted to remove this app but it crashes my settings when removing device administrator. Currently stuck with this app on my phone and im not happy. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150409:	   Once you download this app. There's no going back. You can't uninstall it unless you deactivate it from devise administration, but there's a problem. IT WONT LET YOU!!!!! 
com.achep.acdisplay#150410:	   Not working properly 
com.achep.acdisplay#150414:	   It is awesome. But i am facing problem of unfortunately stopped while adding custom widget. :| Any solution? 
com.achep.acdisplay#150419:	   Can't get the double tap to wake feature to work I click it then try it it doesn't work 
com.achep.acdisplay#150423:	   awesome potential but not stable . work the thee bugs out and it'll be a favorite . 
com.achep.acdisplay#150435:	   This app is not updated for over a year and fingerprint does not work on my s7. It keeps asking for the pin. Have to Uninstall it. So sad because it was my favorite for over 2 years 
com.achep.acdisplay#150437:	   I was bored of my samsung lockscreen. Now this is something new which works without any issues. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150442:	   work,don't use battery,change double tap action to dismiss AC display not lock screen ,add options to show AC display after lock screen and timeout after 15 or 30 seconds,add this feature but don't add bug!because app work 100% correctly.thanks. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150444:	   And I guess it is the problem which every Lollipop user is getting 
com.achep.acdisplay#150446:	   The app is not leaving administrative permission as i want to uninstall the app but as soon as I click on uncheck box it force stops my settings and restarts the UI. Fix this issue as i want uninstall this bloody fake and irritating app. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150450:	   Having moto e3 power not working on it 
com.achep.acdisplay#150453:	  I know that hey won't support security mechanics since "it can only be done badly". However: I won't use the native samsung lock screen and the AcDisplay app just because I don't want someone to just unlock my phone if it's lying on the table for example. Therefore not an option to add unnecessary swipes/clicks and lockscreen above lockscreen... 
com.achep.acdisplay#150462:	   It doesn't work for me, and now I can't even uninstall it, come on, pretty bad app 
com.achep.acdisplay#150476:	  Widgets above time is not working. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150499:	   Ok so I actually liked the app until I realized I cant Uninstall the app not in system settings not through normal drag to Uninstall explain to me why in God's name am I being forced to keep your app on my phone. Update even trying to remove admin privileges to the app settings convienently crashes. I am in able to remove this app 
com.achep.acdisplay#150501:	   This is the display for a lock screen I have dreamed of. It sucks that you can't use a password or any type of security on it but the app does a nice job explaining why so I understand and it does not make me love the app less. Great work. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150503:	   Its like a damn virus. It was fine when I first downloaded it, just didn't like the look of it. But now I can't remove it no matter what I do. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150510:	   It requires Administrator permissions and once granted, you cannot deselect the app as the prompt "Unfortunately AcDisplay has stopped working" every time. Being an administrator app you cannot therefore delete the app! 
com.achep.acdisplay#150517:	   When the app crashes, I reopen it to find that notifications aren't showing anymore 
com.achep.acdisplay#150518:	   The minimalistic design is very pleasing and I really like the functionality. There is one issue: I have a phone where most of the time I use the fingerprint to unlock. Because this needs system administrator privelages, often I will click and my phone will tell me that because of Android security policy I need to enter my pin, and not use fingerprint. Also, it would be simpler if you could set a fingerprint within the lock screen instead of having to clock again to your normal lock screen to unlock. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150528:	   I downloaded this app but i didn't liked so i wanted to unistall the app but cannot unistall because its a device administrator so i went on the device administrator to deactivate it from device administrator but it gives error and settings are stop , now i am very angry on this bullshit app 
com.achep.acdisplay#150529:	  I loved this app soooo much, but the lack of active development is causing some crashes and few bugs. I wish it was taken care of. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150535:	   When I get a notification when it is locked, the screen will stay on, and stay active. I hope this can be fixed. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150555:	   Its  until you want to uninstall it have gone into device administrator but that doesn't work ..have tried to email Dev ..but email not recognised the app itself works well and you can disable it...but I've yet to find a way to uninstall it!! 
com.achep.acdisplay#150558:	   I've been using this app on every phone I have gotten s3 mini z1 and z3+, and it has never failed and appreciate the developer keeping it ad free and no pro version with more features. I just wish there's an option to pick a wallpaper picture instead of just choosing a solid colour or the home screen wallpaper. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150559:	   LG Volt USER. Would not run locker after i restarted my phone. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150560:	  1. WHEN USING LOCK SCREEN FUNCTION WITH PASSWORD CAMERA WILL NOT OPEN. If you want to use the AcDisplay lock screen and a pin, you simply enable AcDisplay on top of your stock lock screen. However, when opening camera from an off display using volume button shortcuts, AcDisplay will be in your way. Also, when using the AcDisplay camera shortcut, you will have to enter your pin before being able to use the camera (versus being able to use camera from the lock screen with the stock lock screen). 2. PHONES WITH FINGER SCANNERS MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY. Many phones such as the Honor 5x, Honor 8, Nexus 5x, and Nexus 6p have a fingerprint scanner that allows you to go from an off display directly to the home screen when your finger is scanned. You cannot do this with AcDisplay, as the AcDisplay lock screen will open up every time your phone is unlocked. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150568:	   Gave it all the permissions it needed and still doesn't work half the time. Notifications will show up some times but not others, which kind of defeats the purpose of it. Sticking with the regular AOD from now on. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150584:	   The lockscreen was amazing but after one or two days the locker is not appearing and i have to open ac display app and turn it off and then back on.This keeps repeating so please fix this 
com.achep.acdisplay#150593:	   This is a great small and free app, but it doesn't solve underlying problem with Android Lollipop 5.0.2 screen lock. I've searched for some app to show small and compact notifications after upgrade from Kitkat 4.4.4 to Lollipop 5.0.2 on my Sony Xperia Z3 compact. Despite this beauty works smooth, it only makes things worse: to unlock a mobile I need to make FOUR actions: press power button, swipe AcDisplay screen, swipe my unlock pattern. This is just ridiculous! 
com.achep.acdisplay#150594:	   It's clean and minimalistic, beautiful. But unfortunately, it is missing a lot of functionality. The media controls rarely work, wave to turn on is broken, and there is no option to enable quick settings on the lockscreen. Please fix! It's the best lockscreen out there! 
com.achep.acdisplay#150595:	  Lock screen didn't work since last 2 weeks when i press lock button then my phones default lock screen come no the lock screen of ac display 
com.achep.acdisplay#150596:	   Brings Ambient Display to most phones. Love the 'wave to wake' feature. My only issue is that I wish lock screen feature could replace my system luck screen rather than sitting on top if it. System limitation I guess. Great app! 
com.achep.acdisplay#150597:	   When the alarm rings, the app stops working and needs to be turned off and on again 
com.achep.acdisplay#150600:	  Waving doesn't unlock/lock the screen, please fix this. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150601:	  I love it but since I installed it I have no more notification when I pulled down the notification bar. I have notifications but i cannot see them. Any idea on how to fix that please? thank you 
com.achep.acdisplay#150603:	   Just a few animation fixes and this app will be even better. Get it now!! 
com.achep.acdisplay#150606:	  Does not work with Smart Lock or fingerprint unlocking. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150614:	  Had to deactivate it because my finger print scanner on my S6 doesn't work when it's active, everytime I opened my screen I was having to put my password in and now I can't even uninstall it??? 
com.achep.acdisplay#150616:	   But fix the home button unlocking...5 month later. And no fix yet.... 
com.achep.acdisplay#150625:	   It starts automatically with reboot.good.but lockscreen crashes sometime.bad.so I have to install picture password locker as secondary locker which also starts automatically after reboot.the combination of two is perfect for me. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150630:	   I have used ac display since the first day I used my opinion handset. Loved the whole concept and the way it worked but totally gutted that apple music does not work on the lock screen. For that reason 4* but if fixed 5* everyday!!! Please fix this issue. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150632:	   The recent button still functions in lockscreen. Fix it 
com.achep.acdisplay#150634:	   Great clean nice lockscreen. what's stopping me from using is that the time is always slower den my system time.. hope there'll be some changes to clear off this issue in the next update.. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150635:	  You guys made a great lock screen. I'm on the HTC 10, my only problem is that the fingerprint scanner doesn't work. It will only ask for my 4 digit passcode after passing the lock screen. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150636:	   When i get home, the smart lock keeps my screen unlocked meaning i dont need to type in a password to unlock it, but with Ac Display set as lock screen, i always have to unlock the phone with a password every time i turn it on.. please fix (: -edit: nevermind i dont have to retype my password but i have to swipe a second time, however if i dont have a password set, then i dont need to swipe twice, i need a password on it tho 
com.achep.acdisplay#150641:	   It crashes every time I try to uninstall it. Warning!! Don't make it a device administrator!!! 
com.achep.acdisplay#150648:	   I can't uninstall it...can you please advise? Doesn't work on edge 7 
com.achep.acdisplay#150649:	   I liked the app but now that it has served its purpose, it cannot be deleted because it has crashed the settings every time I tried to revoke its administration control. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150656:	  not working now after upgrading to marshmallow  
com.achep.acdisplay#150657:	   I really think you should make just a lockscreen. This app is something in between a lockscreen and a notification app and it is not stable all the time. But it looks so beautiful and nice. I can't use it like this and I wish you will make just a lockscreen. It will be a fantastic app in the market. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150658:	   I go to device arministration to deactivate but it keeps saying that settings has stopped everytime i deactivate this app. How can i deactivate and uninstall it?? Please fix this.. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150659:	   tried to uninstall it by going to settings and taking it off as an admin but every time I try, it gives me the same "Unfortunately your settings app has stopped." Any idea how to fix this? 
com.achep.acdisplay#150661:	   How do you hide notification content when they come up? My phone is set to hide content on the lock screen as standard but if I get a notification through this app it can still be read regardless. I can't use the lock screen provided with this app because I can't use the fingerprint scanner to unlock my phone if I do 
com.achep.acdisplay#150662:	   I need to remove this app but it will not let me! It won't even let me disable the entire app. I like the app but I am trouble shooting a microphone issue that happened shortly after installing this app. Please help! 
com.achep.acdisplay#150671:	   Only problem I am facing it while using on MY note 5 with 6.0.1 is that some times it rides over finger print scanner and I need to unlock it using password. Please fix this. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150678:	   The app is great besides the occasional wierd text truncation bug, but I'll have to uninstall it because Android 6 does not let you use your fingerprint to unlock the phone if an app turns off the screen. I really like this app, but I like being able to secure my device and unlock it with my fingerprint 
com.achep.acdisplay#150682:	  Trying to uninstall it. Failed. I did go to the Deactivation section in the security setting. But the uninstallation process killed the "Setting", which makes it impossible to deactivate it from the Administration Activation part. Please fix! Otherwise, it is a good app. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150685:	   Fix the facebook messenger popup problem. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150689:	   The lockscreen becomes blank sometimes with just only the app icons displaying. Is there a fix for this? Running Android 6.0.1 on Galaxy Note 4. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150696:	  Notification problem in jelly bean, fix this will be a great app 
com.achep.acdisplay#150698:	   I would like to uninstall it but when i try my phone says it is a device administrator. When i try to turn it off my settings crashes and its only with this app for some reason 
com.achep.acdisplay#150702:	   I'd say the main issue is the apparent lack of support for fingerprint readers. On my Nexus 5X it just refuses to move past the lock screen after reading my fingerprint, which is rather unfortunate. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150706:	   Tried everything, completely unable to unintell this junk. Crashes the system app 
com.achep.acdisplay#150716:	  Will there be updates that fix stuff..? 
com.achep.acdisplay#150725:	   The app is fine however it has a lot of bugs. The biggest dissapointed is that I can't uninstall it. It has access to device administration and when I am trying to remove it from device administrators Settings app crashes all the time. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150726:	  It was working very well... then it just stopped. i don't know if its a marshmellow problem but it just stopped. they way i was loving it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150732:	   Unable to deactivate admin access! Crashes the settings when I try to do that! Even after restarting the phone. Unable to uninstall! Not working well with the unlocking screen! Factory reset?! Galaxy S6. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150733:	   But is a glitchy mess which constantly fails to work. I enable the lock screen but when I unlock the screen, it gets directly unlocked without showing the actual lock screen. I enable active mode, but I have to manually press the power button everytime I take it out of my pocket. If I lock it and immediately unlock it the lock screen appears twice. If I scroll down my notification bar and lock it, the bar remains on the lock screen. It also constantly keeps taking screenshots of the lock screen. Uninstallin 
com.achep.acdisplay#150735:	   Only problem is it only works in pocket mode. ( it displays my glance screen once I pull the phone out of pocket) and not always on . Anyways battery is not effected much and I like the way simple notifications are handled. Could be the best AOD in future to replace stock S7 
com.achep.acdisplay#150742:	   I haven't had any problems by now. You should add a lock screen security like the LG. Just by tapping a code it unlocks. And at night for the clock to be always on. I hope you keep improving this app cause it's awesome. And one thing, I love the fact that this app doesn't have any annoying ads. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150750:	   I'm enjoying using this, but now if I'm using my phone and I get a text message it will lock my screen and I will need to swipe again to continue using it. Any help in fixing that would be appreciated. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150754:	  Don't get me wrong the app it's very good BUT I have a problem, I want to uninstall the app but the thing is that I can't do it because it I'll say "unfortunately, system settings has stopped" every time I try to deactivate the device administrator 
com.achep.acdisplay#150762:	   It will tell me that every time I try to add widgets the settings crash 
com.achep.acdisplay#150768:	   The best lockscreen I have ever tried but sometimes on Android Marshmallow it doesn't work well and there are some bugs. Need an update 
com.achep.acdisplay#150779:	  It was my favorite lock screen since years but recent updates are making the app work abnormally. The phone keeps waking up every one or two seconds after locking when there is a app notification of any kind in the status bar left un-attended i.e be it a unread message or a pop up notification from apps. I have deactivated active mode but no luck. I hope the issue gets resolved soon. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150787:	   Fantastic application. Really, really like and enjoy this over the stock lockscreen and many other locking applications out there. The only gripe I have (though small) is the animation for dismissing notifications is very crude and glitchy. It works, yes, so I shouldn't complain, but it does not match the rest of the "aesthetic" that the rest of it conveys. Fix that, clean it up, and it's flawless. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150797:	   Media widget doesn't work when it is set as a lockscreen 
com.achep.acdisplay#150803:	   My settings menu crashes every time i try to disable this apps settings to uninstall it, so i can't get rid of it. I'm running stock marshmallow on a nexus 6. I've never encountered an app i could not uninstall. Users be cautious. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150804:	   I love how this works and how clean it is but it locks my phone every time and doesn't let my fingerprint unlock it. Is there any way to fix this? 
com.achep.acdisplay#150812:	   Whenever i use this app,in a day screen flashes sometime when i recieve any notification. I want to use this app so please fix it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150820:	   Make more...patern lock..or another else...n fix lockscreen bug quickly 
com.achep.acdisplay#150824:	   My alarm only goes for a split second then ACDisplay turns it off? I've checked every setting and can't get it fixed. Please help. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150830:	   The lock screen keeps coming up in recent menu. Please fix it 
com.achep.acdisplay#150832:	   Remove the ac in the notification bar its useless... And improve that lock screen, i always have to turn it on and off because it stop working... Other than that, awesome! 5 stars when fixed! 
com.achep.acdisplay#150837:	   It won't get off my phone! 
com.achep.acdisplay#150856:	   I used it for a while and it was very helpful but now it's integrated inside my oneplus 2 and I wanted to uninstall it but I can't. Coz I can not remove it from device administration. Everytime I touch the tick. It takes me back to settings and I can do nothing about it.. So this app is permanently stuck on my phone 
com.achep.acdisplay#150860:	   The issues I'm having on my note 5 is tht it's not working when I take it out of my pocket. Im also having a issue when I charge my phone it gets all glitchy. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150865:	   The Music widget has stopped working for roughly 3 weeks now. Play pause skip etc don't work when pressed. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150870:	   I'm using galaxy note4 in marshmallow version and when I'm pulling out the pen to write quick note the ACdislay crashes down..I think we need a new update ... thank you 
com.achep.acdisplay#150871:	   The lock screen is so beautifully simplistic and so far it's been working great. Only one issue: I have the app set to stay enabled even when there are no notifications, but every so often I'll wake the phone screen and it just gets right into my phone. The lock screen isn't there. So just that one issue. Something I'd really like to see is the ability to set some sort of security to the lock screen, whether it's a password, pin number, or pattern. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150873:	   Motion pretty much doesn't work at all on my moto x 2014 
com.achep.acdisplay#150874:	   Doesn't seem to work seamlessly with lockscreen. I have to swipe once on acdisplay and then once on system lockscreen. 5 star if you fix this! 
com.achep.acdisplay#150879:	   After last night circle animation not working please fix these problem and add some security please do fast 
com.achep.acdisplay#150886:	   This app definitely has potential! but there's no consistent development. I really enjoy this app for the most part, but you can tell there are bugs that need to be addressed. Why not update your app and turn it into a real money maker! I would pay if this app was keep updated.. Just so you know, thanks 
com.achep.acdisplay#150892:	   Cannot even launch the app on my LG G Pro. Please fix it.. I loved this app 
com.achep.acdisplay#150901:	   Latest update has issues with music controls showing up on lock screen. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150908:	   There is a bug when I lock the screen the screen locking sound comes six times please improve it. Then I will rate five stars 
com.achep.acdisplay#150909:	   Great software and very minimalistic. But recently it has been crashing a lot. Hope to see an update. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150911:	   for those of u whose power button is not working...this is an amazing app..totally stable, never hangs 
com.achep.acdisplay#150916:	   Wishing the brightness to be adjustable to be dimmer than usual so that this can be great in the dark. It might be just me but the waving gesture doesn't work as nicely because it takes time to cover the proximity sensor with my hand and release it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150926:	   The only thing that doesn't work are the controls for the music player. I don't know if it's because I use poweramp or it's a setting in poweramp. Other than that, it's perfect 
com.achep.acdisplay#150931:	   Now after the update the digital clock doesnt work anymore. Fix it please 
com.achep.acdisplay#150935:	   Battery friendly and simple. This is ideal if you're looking to keep your phone looking light and modern. Kudos to the devs. Edit : Hope the devs will address this problem. As of late the Lock screen doesn't turn off if I get a notification. I've set it to turn off five seconds after I get a notification but it doesn't. It will show the display and time without switching off which can be quite annoying when youre in bed and get a notification that makes the display light up all night. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150943:	  Nice design and concept. Unfortunately on my Nexus 6P with 6.0 it doesn't work as a lock screen. The device still goes to the native/stock lock screen after getting past AcDisplay lock screen. Can anything be done about this? 
com.achep.acdisplay#150946:	  Just didn't work as advertised. As a lock Screen the basics work but trying to add widgets just became an exercise in futility. The app would always respond with 'Unfortunately Settings has stopped' , which meant my lock screen became a blank screen. I reached out to the developer via email but have had no response. Deleted this appliction 
com.achep.acdisplay#150956:	   Overall great app. On my Samsung Note 3, after upgrading to Android 5.0, giving problems when I plug in earphones and using the note function. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150969:	   I enable all settings needed but It did not work. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150978:	   Pressing home button twice unlocks too, but that's not the purpose of the app. Please fix, you already have access to notifications and device administrator. Also I have root access and xposed. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150983:	   But I would love to be able to set a separate lockscreen wallpaper, instead of the home screen one I use. Also sometimes the app crashes and unless I kill and start the process again the notifications are not shown after that. 
com.achep.acdisplay#150985:	   It brings up the "use fingerprint because security policy" thing sometimes. If you can get it to turn the screen off by root or something (or however you can fix this) 5 stars 
com.achep.acdisplay#150986:	   Cant remove it from the list of device administrators. As soon as i do that settings app crashes. Help?-Galaxy Note 5 
com.achep.acdisplay#150989:	   Its one of the nicest apps available. But the pause button of music player doesnt works . please fix that !!! 
com.achep.acdisplay#150995:	   Please add an option to set your own wallpaper from your gallery, and a pass code option please! Then I'll give 5 but there's this bug in which when I press the home key my desktop shows up! 
com.achep.acdisplay#151011:	   Issues on m8 lollipop 
com.achep.acdisplay#151023:	   The wave to unlock feature doesn't work on my phone.....please fix it in the next update 
com.achep.acdisplay#151031:	  Only problem is with devices with fingerprint unlock. If I get a notification, and I try to unlock with fingerprint, it accepts the fingerprint then afterwards I still need to enter backup unlock code like PIN or password to unlock the phone. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151035:	  Not loading 
com.achep.acdisplay#151041:	   The settings and features in AcDisplay are adequate, or more than enough for many users. However, the lockscreen beta feature needs a lot of work (I've sent an email regarding some possible fixes). The app itself is basic, and allows everyone to get the most out of it, while it's functions are very aesthetically pleasing. Also, there is a very short delay between the lock screen activating and the screen turning off, which might be noticed by a few people, although most wouldn't figure it out very quickly. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151042:	   This app keeps shutting down my phone once I set it down, fix this bug and I give it 5 stars it's really good, without that problem 
com.achep.acdisplay#151043:	  (LG G3 D855) Everything is perfect except one major issue. After I receive a phone call, the AcDisplay lockscreen unlocks the phone and not putting the phone back to lock state itself. When it's in my pocket, after a missed call, apps are opened by accidental touches because of the phone is unlocked. This is so annoying and please fix this big issue asap. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151044:	   Please fix it immediately 
com.achep.acdisplay#151046:	   It was working fine full some time back, but now I can't view the notifications on my lock screen. Don't know what's the issue. Please help 
com.achep.acdisplay#151053:	   Sometimes works, most of the times does not. I have rooted Android 6 and with xposed module with all permissions but still doesn't work well. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151054:	   This is a great little handy app, the only problem I'm facing is the wave to wake feature, it isn't working properly for me, hope this issue is looked into for the next few updates 
com.achep.acdisplay#151055:	   This application has attached it's self to my phone and I'm unable to remove it! I've reached out to the developers for help on how to remove the admin rights and no one has responded. I have turned off all of it's functions but when you attempt to remove the admin for the application it freezes the crashes the setting! I am reaching out to Google for assistance since I belive this app is pure spam! Galaxy Note 5. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151057:	   Although i loved the app as it is the most simplistic lockscreen but please fix two things. First the notification of active mode in the notification panel which is highly irritating and please, please add your custom pattern lock it would be perfect then. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151076:	   Bug 
com.achep.acdisplay#151079:	   Its like i pull down the notification panel and i lock the phone...and when i unlock it the notification panel still stays as it is.... down on the lockscreen! Which actually negates the base of a lockscreen whatsoever! Fix this issue anyhow! 
com.achep.acdisplay#151081:	   I REALLY like it. The only problem it has is it has no passcode. That is a deal breaker for me. If it gets one then I'll give it 5 stars. Great lockscreen otherwise though! 
com.achep.acdisplay#151086:	   Not working on miui7. waiting for fix soon 
com.achep.acdisplay#151092:	   Although this app is great, but still it has some things that need to be fixed, like messages not opening the application. If this is fixed it will win hands down. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151103:	   When lock screen active, a successful finger scan takes me to pin enter even, this is a major Hassel. Liked the idea of reading notifications from locked screen but this finger print scanner needs fixing 
com.achep.acdisplay#151107:	   I tried to give the timeout policy permissions but the app keeps crashing the settings. So bummed. Favorite app for sure. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151119:	  Sumtyms apps doesn't work...it has alot of bugs.... No update 4 a long time..... Stil it has bugs... Fix it soon..... 
com.achep.acdisplay#151122:	    so bad she does not removed from any phone 
com.achep.acdisplay#151134:	   The active display is not working otherwise it's a great app. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151136:	   The app is amazing and works better than the Moto display, in my opinion! But there's a thing that really need to be fix: in Android 5.0 or 6.0, when we unlock the Acdisplay, we have to swipe up the Android lock screen again to show pattern lock screen. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151140:	  I love it but, when I get notifications from facebook messenger, the messenger chat head is showing up over the lockscreen, so it's pretty much useless. Fix it and 5 stars 
com.achep.acdisplay#151163:	   This morning my acdisplay suddenly stop working, I tried to uninstall n reinstall agn. I even try to turn off every security 
com.achep.acdisplay#151165:	   I've been using it for years and it's just great. Simple, beautiful and functional. The app is awesome but a couple of months ago started doing weird things, notifications dissappear even if I don't open them, the music widget doesn't work as it should, after I unlock the screen 2 or 3 times it stops working. These problems are really annoying and it was working great before. Please fix it, I would love to keep using this app. I'm using a Xiaomi MI 3. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151166:	  Doesn't work 
com.achep.acdisplay#151167:	   would you please , find a way to fix the screen lag? otherwise I love the app. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151170:	   Works as advertised. Very few bugs. Seems stable and useful. I hate how if I have an app open, ACDisplay will close it, and I'll have to manually go back into it every time I open my phone up. The feature that allows me to go directly into a notification doesn't work, but that's not a big deal. The design and amount of options are what make this app worth having. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151177:	   Ummmm it doesn't work at all for me and I can't Uninstaller it off my phone. Please help! 
com.achep.acdisplay#151181:	   As you know ASUS has no option to disable fabric lock screen you can just put it to swipe so i get delays on locker if you can fix it, pls fix it! And please delete Ac option reminder on notification bar 
com.achep.acdisplay#151190:	   It work fine for few weeks, but since last 2-3 days notification are not showing on lock screen, pls help me to resolve the problem as the app and concept is very good,really help a lot ,waiting for reply 
com.achep.acdisplay#151195:	   Can't add any widgets on lockscreen, setting suddenly stopped working. Would be better if have a built in pattern/pin locks 
com.achep.acdisplay#151210:	   I used this on my old phone and if was flawless and I loved it. Now I have switched the the nexus 6p and am having some trouble. I noticed that sometimes when I had ac display activated I would not be able to use the finger print sensor even after I unlocked ac display and had to do a password. This is very frustrating so I cannot use ac display. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151226:	  Being a device administrator keeps getting disabled but other services are kept on. Please fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#151229:	   Awesome lockscreen for seeing and handling notifications. My favorite feature is that I can swipe from anywhere in any direction to unlock. Has a few (very) annoying (recent) bugs such as locking the screen while I'm using my phone if I get a notification or the proximity sensor causing unwanted locks while using 
com.achep.acdisplay#151260:	   When I try to uncheck this tool from device administrators, android system app crashes... nexus 5 2013, android 6.0.1 with march update. Fix it asap 
com.achep.acdisplay#151265:	   Edit: 'Had to uninstall. Started taking too much resources/battery in the background I don't know, if it's a bug or anything. Kindly fix it.' Really cool. It's a no nonsense app. Please do rem though this app keeps on running in the background and though it's not really a super heavy app but it's not feather weight either. It is perfectly fine by me, coz I find it to be totally worth it. It gives you a buttery smooth experience and the lock screen looks wise is damn cool. Love it. Thank you so much!! 
com.achep.acdisplay#151273:	   After i updated my fone to 5.0 lollipop d lockscreen became buggy. It unlocks by pressing home button n sometimes after swipe unlocking it locks d display again.. please fix this. Also a suggestion to include always on mode like v find on d new galaxy s7 n lg g5.. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151275:	   Once alarm rings this locker stops working. Goes back to default phone locker. Got to disable and re-enable aclocker. Do fix this bug, much appreciated. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151279:	   Proximity sensor is not working properly. To wake it up, have to hold the proximity sensor for at least 5 sec. Phone model: Infocus 
com.achep.acdisplay#151284:	   Would have given 5 stars. But the active mode isn't working. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151286:	   The app is amazing but there is an lag between opening from locks screen and home screen display. Please fix it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151288:	   Doesn't work with fingerprint API so you either have lower security or you have to unlock your device twice. Also you have to jump through hoops to uninstall this app, trying to deactivate it only causes Settings to crash. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151289:	   Please develop some apps with same interface for Call screen, music app and lock screen with pin :) . Anyway, its lock screen didn't work on my xiaomi ( default lock screen comes first :( ] 
com.achep.acdisplay#151295:	   Active mode just doesn't work. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151296:	   I have given all permissions but still the app doesn't work on my le 1s. I think its because of the fact that the stock lockscreen cannot be disabled in my phone. Any work around? 
com.achep.acdisplay#151298:	   This is a fantastic app for someone coming from the Motorola ecosystem that misses the active display as badly as I did. There needs to be a way to swipe the media player out of the way to access the normal acdisplay screen. There also needs to be an addition that brings up acdisplay when the phone is picked up after sitting for a set period of time. I have issues with the proximity wake but pulling it out of my pocket always seems to work. Otherwise this is a fantastic app! 
com.achep.acdisplay#151299:	   When the pop up notifications appear , ac display will messed up , btw hope you can fix this glitch anyway good apps 
com.achep.acdisplay#151308:	   Works for a period, then crashes and stops showing notifications. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151309:	   Nexus fingerprint doesn't work with this app, was a huge inconvenience. Hence uninstalled. Otherwise I loved the app. A sleek interface for those who mean business. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151314:	   Don't get it 
com.achep.acdisplay#151336:	   I love this app the only problem is, it takes much RAM. Even recommended this to my friends and they loved it. Thumbs up! 
com.achep.acdisplay#151340:	   Installed this app to customize the clock font of the Always On Display for my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. It appears to have spiffy options but it wasn't what I needed. I decided to uninstall. I was unable to uninstall via the phone settings and part of the problem was that I allowed the app to run as a phone administrator. It wouldn't deactivate as a phone administrator. Had to uninstall from within the app by selecting the "?" circle icon in the upper right and selecting the uninstall hyperlink. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151345:	   Had some problems with the app permissions but managed to get it to work 
com.achep.acdisplay#151350:	   pressing the recent button or home button closes the lock screen .... plz fix this issue ... i want to use this as my primary lockscreen but the recent button and the home button issue is forcing me to use different locker app ... plz fix this ... 
com.achep.acdisplay#151352:	    this app from my Galaxy S7. Keeps crashing when I try to remove from device administrator. Since I cannot remove the app as an administrator I cannot uninstall without a device reset. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151353:	   When you want to unlock the phone it demands I put the pin in and not use my fingerprint and then sometimes it works with the fingerprint. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151354:	  I love this app so much but there is one reason I don't use it. That is no lock or protection. If I ever lose my phone or my friend takes it they can easily access my messages, pictures and other things I like to keep private. AC if u are reading this please implement a lock . I know that it can't be really secure but can u try. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151361:	   One of the features I really looked forward to using when I bought my Moto X is Moto Display, which is essentially this, but with lots of annoying problems. When you tweak the settings right, acdisplay is a beautiful and useful lock screen. The primary annoyance is that you still have to go through the built-in lock screen which means multiple layers to unlock the phone. But there's probably nothing to be done about that. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151366:	   Its awesome, but sometimes when i turn on the screen it stayes for 1 sec then my screen goes off!! Plz fix it.... 
com.achep.acdisplay#151373:	   Slide from corners and double tap to sleep are not working on my device. Wave to wake up feature is not proper to accuracy. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151375:	   Every time you unlock it with power button it doesn't work and most irritating thing is only if u r lucky enough this lock screen display will work or else on clicking unlock button it opens up to standard or say stock display screen plz improve on this and there's lot of lag in this app 
com.achep.acdisplay#151377:	   I love the app. It's super sleek and nice. But ever since my phone updated to marshmallow it's stopped working. Hope it comes back soon 
com.achep.acdisplay#151387:	   New note 5. All permissions granted. Soft reset didn't fix. Won't act as lock screen either. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151389:	   After the update I have a lot of issues about rotate screen etc.. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151390:	  I would give this 5 stars but i cant Unistal the application, iv stoped the service and deactivate everything and nothing, please fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#151407:	   Doesn't work reliably with my GS7 edge. I wanted to turn off AOD and use this but it doesn't have an always on mode. Please consider adding 
com.achep.acdisplay#151413:	   I used this app for a long time on my Asus Zenfone 5. About 1 month ago, mostly right after unlocking the screen and sometimes randomly, the display tilts/shifts with an absurd angle and goes grayscale and then shortly after phone freezes, makes me do a hard reset. I thought it was a phone problem because I hadn't installed a new app. But then I thought maybe it's about this app, because it happened mostly after unlocking. So i disabled it and the problem solved. Hope this gets fixed. Cheers 
com.achep.acdisplay#151415:	   Whenever I wake my phone I have to wait a good 2 seconds for the acdisplay lockscreen to appear. Other than that, the design is very good and it would be amazing with this big sorted out. In addition, the dynamic background feature doesn't work I just get a black background 
com.achep.acdisplay#151417:	   I'm using Galaxy S7 and was not showing my whatsapp notification icon when i get a message. This semi fixes it, but notification goes away after 5 to 10 seconds. PLEASE MAKE IT STAY PERMANENTLY when in always on Display mode. Also it makes forces me to use a pattern to unlock if notification goes away to unlock my phone instead of using the fingerprint...BS! Please FIX. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151419:	   Nice app, but, on Android 5.1.1 sometimes works, sometimes doesn't...pls fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#151430:	   The wave to wake feature does not work sometimes 
com.achep.acdisplay#151434:	   Need more improvement...oh after update sometimes it's steel crash to my galaxy s6 edge... 
com.achep.acdisplay#151436:	  Great app but have some issues with Samsung fingertips, after some time it forces you type the password 
com.achep.acdisplay#151443:	  not working automatically after screen off we need to replacement lock screen like glance plus 
com.achep.acdisplay#151453:	  I have installed in my Lenono Vibe P1m, but its not working. The app is not getting any administrator rights. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151462:	   Best app on playstore..loving it..find a bug though, when fullscreen mode is disabled, ther is a notification,that swipe down to exit fullscreen 
com.achep.acdisplay#151470:	  I've been using it for quite a while and love it. Only complaints are with lollipop's new lock screen (wish it could go straight to pattern lock rather than slide) The design is elegant and a beautiful way of showing notifications, much cleaner than the lollipop notifications. There is one thing I'd love to have implemented: music control. Would it be possible for you to choose to play/pause/fwd/back depending on what controls are in the notification? Edit: holy crap thank you!! He listened! Edit: Podcast addict does not seem to have playback control. not sure if this is a fix on the display side. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151478:	  Great app, really like, but it has an issue with the Note 5's screen-off memo taking mode; the screen will go completely off in around 10 seconds whether I'm writing or not. Tried all the settings, can't seem to fix that. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151482:	   I reported this bug 2 months or so ago and no one responded to the bug report. Ac display interferes with keyboards, and it is replicated easily. When the device is put to sleep or the screen times out while in an active text box (tested mainly with hangouts, but it happened while typing this review), the keyboard will not input text when you wake the device up. You have to back out of the message for it to work again. This was tested on a nexus 6, multiple roms, Google kb and SwiftKey 
com.achep.acdisplay#151493:	  It would lime to Uninstaller this app from my phone because it doesn't work but all I can do is deactivate it great app 
com.achep.acdisplay#151509:	   Its not working on my samsung galaxy j7 when i installed it its shows nothing on my devise nd even i can't uninstall it just waste of time or waste of Memory use 
com.achep.acdisplay#151510:	  Lock screen of this app doesn't work unless u get a notification 
com.achep.acdisplay#151513:	   This app is great however I use musixmatch as my default music player but the media buttons on the lockscreen won't respond so I'm guessing Acdisplay doesn't support it, please fix that up. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151529:	   I used this lock screen for a very long time and loved it, but I had to stop using it because there was a bug with it that would disable/shut off my alarms immediately as they were starting. This, in turn made me late for work on several occasions. If that one bug would or could have been fixed... 5 stars, best lock screen ever. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151538:	   Sometime lock screen doesn't work 
com.achep.acdisplay#151550:	   On my S6 Edge it's not working...i'm saad. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151551:	   Oh no... It's crashing and no notifications... Here was my take when I just started using the app.... But.. Disappointed... Can we please fix the issues! Awesome minimalistic locker... Just works.. Tried so many screen locks... But this one rocks and works each time.. Specially when you have android 5.0 versions... Love this app. Cheers! Look forward to more features soon! Great job by the development team 
com.achep.acdisplay#151552:	   Very minimalistic and easy to use. Had a small problem where the notifications wouldn't show up after say, 5 months or so but a quick uninstall and reinstall fixed it just fine 
com.achep.acdisplay#151558:	   This is a gud lockscreen but security problems. Give a security please... 
com.achep.acdisplay#151565:	   It's a couple of days now that it doesn't show the notification icons anymore. Fix please! 
com.achep.acdisplay#151567:	   When we are listening to FM radio and the phone locks the signal from FM radio gets disconnected. Pls fix. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151569:	   on an lg g4 here and overall happy with ac display. one thing ive noticed is that after you lock your screen and immediately wake it up, ac display hasn't had time to lock? it does show up within a sec or so but I'd prefer it to show up asap. i have it set to no delay either but it is being delayed. once this is fixed I dont mind changing my review to 5 stars  
com.achep.acdisplay#151572:	  This would be perfect if you include a dedicated unlock system so you can unlock the phone straight from it and not use the built in. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151576:	  Doesn't work with lollipop. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151586:	  Add 1 feature double tap on screen to wake up your phone and i can't use double tap to sleep phone on any screen 
com.achep.acdisplay#151592:	   This app is almost flawless but I still can't stand that lockscreen clock, it's kinda too low and not centered, fix this and you'll have 5 stars 
com.achep.acdisplay#151595:	   Did not work for me. Yes, U enabled permissions and turned it on within the app. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151597:	   I really do like my new lockscreen, but i does have some bugs to it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151599:	   It's so simple and elegant. However, I've been noticing something that inhibits me from giving this app five stars. Sometimes it just stops reading notifications and I need to clear all the data on the app to fix it. Please fix. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151605:	   works fine... but if the display turns on when i have a balance msg or any popup msgs in background, the ac display lock screen starts to flicker like it has gone mad. thats the only issue with this app. I have been waiting for a fix for so long but devs are so reluctant about this issue. so i m giving only 3 stars. And add support for Music match player 
com.achep.acdisplay#151606:	   One major issue. At least one option " sleep mode never time out" should be needed. And turn off the notification option. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151607:	   EDIT 2: Small glitch I've noticed is when I lock the phone with my notification tray open, it remains open over the lockscreen. | Sleek and functional/minimal. Looks so much better than the stock lockscreen. I've noticed a couple of bugs:the swipe animation freezes sometimes, and the clock has a lag in updating the time when the screen turns on. The only thing I didn't like was how I could only add one widget, and that when I did, it covered the clock. Other than that - great! 
com.achep.acdisplay#151611:	   I can not remove from my phone and since I downloaded it my phone has not worked right at all 
com.achep.acdisplay#151615:	   Because amoled doesn't use back light, setting the background to black with this lock screen will save battery life. The contrast also looks nice. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151618:	   Please please PLEASE add swipe patterns and PIN codes. This is my favourite lock screen but I can't use it as I want my phone to be safe. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151621:	    but the only problem with this app is that it has no security feature...pls change it in the next update so i will rate it 5star... 
com.achep.acdisplay#151629:	   If the screen didn't go all white when you unlock wasting battery power and if the lockscreen did not switch on for no apparent reason every minute without any notifications wasting mammoth amounts of battery power this app would have worked. But no, it's a fail for me. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151630:	   1. While locking it take some time to kick in.. 2. Acdisplay services in notification bar is frustrating. Remove it if possible. 3. Active mode is not working like double tapping and waving.. fix it and i will give you 5 stars 
com.achep.acdisplay#151635:	   I wanted to like it. I like the simple interface but the problem is that this works randomly sometimes I saw it sometimes I didn't. It would constantly go from this to my normal lock screen. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151644:	   My phone will crash and restart when using this apps 
com.achep.acdisplay#151650:	   It was crashing frequently, so I thought I would uninstall it. Only it wouldn't uninstall. I like the design and function I just want it to work. And I'd also like to be able to uninstall it. Have the Samsung s4 
com.achep.acdisplay#151654:	  widget not working for me ..it crash everytime ichoose widget..im on kitkat 4.4.2 lg..but still i donated..hope theres a fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#151657:	   Sometimes softlocks my phone and I have to do a battery pull to fix it :/ other wise it's an amazing app 
com.achep.acdisplay#151658:	   All features are awesome as compared to Moto Display. But active mode isn't working. I tried it many times. And I need it more than other features. So I uninstalled it quickly. Please fix this issue ASAP. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151660:	   It doesn't work for Nexus 6 with Marshmallow update 
com.achep.acdisplay#151668:	   1) Remove the permanent notifications that show up in your notification bar, it's distracting. I went through the settings and I didn't find anything. 2) fix the delay issue when unlocking the screen. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151672:	  Looks great, but the app crashes every time I try to access the widgets! Would be 5 stars if fixed 
com.achep.acdisplay#151679:	   The only problem I have ran into is when I try and use the Screen off memo on my galaxy note 5 the screen goes to sleep while I'm writing the memo. It is really annoying. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151680:	   Just downloaded it. Hopefully this beta version doesn't have too many bugs. Love it so far! 
com.achep.acdisplay#151681:	  Customisable and looks good, but Spotify controls don't work. Could we get a fix for this, cheers. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151685:	   Found that when I have an alarm set and it goes off, the app bugs out and stops working (resets to my default lockscreen) and I have to turn the app off and on again. Other than the issue stated, I love the app and how it looks/works. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151689:	   I absolutely love the look, feel, and simplicity of this lockscreen, HOWEVER, can you please fix the issue with my phone opening when I press the home/back/app kill buttons. This defeats the entire purpose of having a lockscreen if I do not need to swipe to open my phone. I ended up having to use my phones pin swipe lock screen to ensure my phone doesn't open randomly. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!! 
com.achep.acdisplay#151694:	  Not getting deactivate plzz help me 
com.achep.acdisplay#151697:	   Lg spirit 4G. Android 5.1 the app snoozes my alarms and makes them useless. Sometimes showing my homescreen first for a second and then goes into lockscreen. Wave function dosn't work sometimes. I like it and I will rate 5 if you fix these bugs 
com.achep.acdisplay#151699:	   Only problem is it doesn't show persistent notifications and add lock screen pin/password/pattern feature 
com.achep.acdisplay#151702:	   I didn't mind the lock screen it was easy to setup and get running. The wave to wake up didn't work the best.. My biggest upset was trying to uninstall the app.. It was very hard and I couldn't do it through my phone I had to do it through the app store. But very easy to use and easy to setup. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151704:	   Currently forces me to enter PIN instead of using the fingerprint sensor. I really want to start using this app again but the bug is rather annoying. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151705:	   I can not get the app to lock my Samsung S5 screen. I have tried multiple times and it has shown up only once for me. I do have it set for no delay, but that's not what I'm getting. So disappointing. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151713:	   We can not access notification centre quick controls on the lock screens please keep that option 
com.achep.acdisplay#151714:	   It works, unfortunately I can't see the notifications using my flip case. I searched the settings and I couldn't find anything to move the notification area to the upper top instead of the center. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151718:	  Very slick and working well so far. Only gripe being that I can't get BBC Weather to show up on the lock screen. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151724:	   Why it's doesn't work on my Samsung jelly bean can you fix it pls 
com.achep.acdisplay#151725:	  Fix the interference with Nexus imprint. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151729:	   I was looking for something like this. Amazing performance! Just one thing i want the developer team to know that the music player widget is not working, is it not supporting on my device (Nokia X+) or some settings problems? Kindly let me know. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151736:	   The only issue I have discovered is the "AcDisplay services" in the notification shade, it bugs me everytime and it also non-removable, if you have an option to hide that from there, it will be great for a 5-star. Overall, its really good. I highly recommend it if your lockscreen is crap and you want something more like Material Design, but of course, there will be issues that bring down the good things, but if the good things are really good until you forget about the flaws, 4 stars will be rated. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151747:	   I have LG Optimus G and ad soon as try to add a widget the app crashes and it says "settings have stopped". 
com.achep.acdisplay#151750:	   Doesn't work! 
com.achep.acdisplay#151752:	  Minimalism perfection. Plus the addition of widgets, AcDisplay is the only lock-screen I care to use. Bug: After changing settings or restarting my phone, AcDisplay will either take 3-5 seconds to show up, revealing my home screen first, or simply not come on at all. It fixes with turning it off and back on, but obviously this is annoying. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151771:	   Active mode doesn't work most of the time... Also there is delay in lockscreen even when it's set to no delay 
com.achep.acdisplay#151775:	   Loved the app, and deserves 5 stars, bit has too too many bugs. Pls fix them, its a brilliant substitute to moto display for my oneplus two. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151779:	   I have a s6 edge+ and I can't use my fingerprint. I click the home button and it exits the app then goes to my default Lock screen. Please fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#151780:	   It doesn't work on my device. And when I'm trying to delete it. It won't allow me to. It keeps on saying that I need to deactivate it first. But there's no way to deactivate it. Don't get it if you have the Samsung Galaxy S3 like me. Run as far away from this app as you can. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151786:	   I like it a lot, but it still has some issues. For example, if i have an alarm turned on and when it rings and i dismiss it, my regular lockscreen appears. This also happens if i press the home button. I'm with Lenovo A859. I granted access to notifications and everything, but sometimes it doesn't overwrite my stock lockscreen. Could anyone give me an advice about this? 
com.achep.acdisplay#151801:	   Frequent Crashes.... 
com.achep.acdisplay#151805:	  You better like it, because it won't work without admin manager rights and you cannot cannot uninstall it. You are stuck with it forever, you cannot even move it to your SD card. BAD BAD BAD situation. Wish I never installed it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151807:	   there is something really annoying! with my note 5 when I'm taking a screen-off memo it turns the screen off after the time set for inactivity!!!! and another thing.. I can't use the fingerprint directly through it.. i have to swipe first which very annoying!!! 
com.achep.acdisplay#151823:	   I really like it, but the only problem is that I can't uninstall? It gives me the option to disable, but there's no uninstall. I went to the application settings instead of the Play Store and the uninstall option is grayed out. EDIT: I'm silly, I realised it's because it was running as a device administrator and I didn't disable be for uninstalling. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151824:	   If I crashed as much as this app, my license would be revoked. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151833:	   DEV NO LONGER SUPPORTING. SEE LAST UPDATE DATE. -- NOTE USERS..... UNLOCKS WHEN HOME BUTTON IS PRESSED. DEV DOESNT CARE. NO RESPONSE TO PAST EMAILS. TRIED AGAIN, STILL SAME ISSUE. NOTE 5, 5.1.1. **I RECOMMEND SNAPLOCK, THE DEV RESPONDS** 
com.achep.acdisplay#151845:	   This app is fantastic regardless! I would love some features like lock screen options, etc. But either way you did a great job. I was using Nils previously and stopped and really didn't find another one I liked until now but I have to try it out and see how it worked in my everyday use. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151849:	   Not qorth downloading for note 5 users. Wake up seems to have problems have to wave carefully to wake up the device. God qhy would I want it. Now its sticking on to my phone not getting uninstalked as well. Guess i have to factory reset and lose all the app for this worthless app. Thank you for creation pain in my a** 
com.achep.acdisplay#151856:	   It doesn't work everytime... 
com.achep.acdisplay#151860:	   I've found that it's using nearly 250 mb of RAM so unfortunately I had to disable it... If You can fix that issue it would be great. Thanks 
com.achep.acdisplay#151861:	   I luv the app... But I'm not getting notification popups on my lockscreen at all.. Please fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#151872:	  Please guys... fix the bugs... I don't want to have this app... Can somebody tell me how to uninstall this app... because this app won't uninstall saying u have to deactivate first!! 
com.achep.acdisplay#151885:	  On my Galaxy S3 this app doesn't work as it should in just about all cases. It wakes up about every 20 sec even though there are no notifications; gesture to wake it up doesn't work; the open animation is slower than stock, etc. Overall it's probably not suited to work with phones that aren't current models. Would love to hear back from the developer as well. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151886:	  Bugs too much! 
com.achep.acdisplay#151891:	   This thing is great. However some bugs need to be fixed like the lock screen. Also it would be great if a security option like a pin or pattern can be applied while unlocking the phone. Hoping improvements. Cheers. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151899:	   It has pause and change of song but not stability once only it visible and if screen off and after on invisible. Lockscreen and active mode should both in same option and in notification tray it should be invisible. I don't like it Using More Ram and Battery fix it and not stabile some times. Gestures should have access to use phone apps.it can be easily bypassed by pressing minimize button,home button, accidentally touch or pressing of any button fix it, R u work r not no update for your app I hate u...!! 
com.achep.acdisplay#151914:	   I really do like this lock screen cause its simple and it doesn't drain battery life and since i have an s6 that's important. Update : no more issues when it comes to security. I just added the stock lock code on my s6 so when i swipe i also have the requirement of a pw. Great job with this app. Also my music player on the display is working now. Perfect lock screen.  
com.achep.acdisplay#151920:	   The sensor doesn't sense the wave signals at the very first instant.! It takes time to detect and it's no use of using that feature if this problem remains.! 
com.achep.acdisplay#151930:	  Lockscreen sometimes have little issues,otherwise the best app I am using 
com.achep.acdisplay#151931:	   Widgets are not working on LG G3 and the Facebook Messenger Chat Heads appear on top of the screen lock when somebody sends a message. Besides that it's a great screen locker, cool design and useful features. Would also like some quick settings buttons somewhere. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151933:	   The only issue that irritates me is when a phone call comes it unlocks the device automatically and never lock it again! which is quite unexpected! 
com.achep.acdisplay#151934:	  I tried using this as a lock screen, but it had some problems. You can't set a separate wallpaper for it. You can't set custom shortcuts for unlock areas that aren't just dialer/camera (what about SMS? or a custom activity?). It doesn't seem to block the home button if you have your system lock screen disabled. If you *don't* disable your system lock screen, it takes about 5 seconds for AC display to appear when you wake up your phone. It doesn't report widget size to widgets, so many can't work properly. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151942:	   Good work dev(s). Crashes sometimes, but it makes my phone experience THAT much better. 
com.achep.acdisplay#151945:	   I dnt knw if there is any type of setting or not..bcz in my xiaomi mi4i it is not working.I installed twice.I enable lock screen also..But every time it shows my default lock screen..please tell me solution 
com.achep.acdisplay#151948:	   Works ok for email, doesn't work at all for txts. Now I can't deactivate so I can uninstall wtf 
com.achep.acdisplay#151953:	   I'm loving it. But there is an issue. When i get a call my display remains off it i use its lookscreen. This lock screen is awesome. Just fix this issue. Then i will give u 5stars. I'm running 5.0.2 
com.achep.acdisplay#151982:	   when i turn off the data and got popup about data usage then screen blinks btw that popup nd ac lockscreen im using cm12.1 5.1.1 plz fix this otherwise its awesome 
com.achep.acdisplay#151983:	  Nice but i would love my own background. And another issue is that there is no security features like a pattern unlock. Other than that really good work 
com.achep.acdisplay#151985:	   Awesome app but plz solve that call screen problem 
com.achep.acdisplay#151986:	  I really loved this app. It solves a lot of problem which I never knew I had. I just have a feature request: Can we have less brightness when using it in active mode? 
com.achep.acdisplay#151988:	   Kinda Works Flawlessly Until I Recieve A Whatsapp Notification and the Name of The sender is Visible even when ive Kept Everything Hidden In The Privacy Settings... Fix That And 5 Stars are Yours... 
com.achep.acdisplay#151994:	   Bugs i guess on 4.2 jelly bean. Wave to wake doesn't always work when proximity sensor is covered with hand. But yes it always works when phone is taken out of pocket. That's the only bug that i noticed till now. Otherwise a great app. So, Please release an update with these bugs fixed and get that remaining one  
com.achep.acdisplay#152003:	   When i swipe down the notification, the animation not smooth enough, please fix it for 5 
com.achep.acdisplay#152017:	  Can't control Spotify from Lockscreen. Please fix it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152020:	   It won't work idk why 
com.achep.acdisplay#152022:	   Some bugs but still the best out there. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152028:	  Lock screen does not rotate. Otherwise good app. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152032:	  Can't uninstall it.. As soon as I try to deactivate it as device administrator, settings crashes . 
com.achep.acdisplay#152036:	   I love this app and enjoy using it, but every time I try to turn on the screen I'll hit the button and it'll take a couple seconds to come up. Used to not have the problem but I do now and it is incredibly annoying. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152046:	  only problem is.. not sure whether all devices have the same issue but in mine it uses up a lot of RAM ..sometimes even up to 400 MB 
com.achep.acdisplay#152047:	   When I get a call, screen doesn't show caller details. I've to manually press power button to actually see who's calling. This is a major issue needs to be attended immediately. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152048:	   I had to stop using it because it would keep crashing, although I loved everything about it, give it a try and see if you have better luck 
com.achep.acdisplay#152051:	   Whats app notifications are not working 
com.achep.acdisplay#152056:	   When i set my swipe options to camera and dialer i cant see them on the black blackround...they still work when i swipe up on the lock screen but can u fix this so that you can see the camera and dialer against the black backround...five stars shall be given. Thanks 
com.achep.acdisplay#152063:	  Didn't work for me. Uninstalling is a pain, but just look at the question mark arms it'll guide you thru it 
com.achep.acdisplay#152065:	   I can't access my notification bar from this lock screen but from every other lock screen! Once you got this... This app is just amazing!!the best lockscreen app! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152066:	  Great app! Very simple and elegant. Yet this is a problem when it comes to the lock screen feature. I would really like a pattern to be implemented instead of a simple swipe to unlock. Besides this, i really love it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152072:	   What happens? Used to work some time ago and now when I installed again, simple doesn't work anymore! It has some kind of incompatibility with cyanogenmod 12.1? Let me know and I'll try again and report the feedback. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152076:	   Its a great app. Helped me lot when my phone power button got damaged. I would like to have one more feature. Waking up by double tapping the screen. Some times that interval for screen wakeup is a problem. So adding this feature will help a lot.. Thanks 
com.achep.acdisplay#152078:	   Seriously??? Required Permissions? It doesn't work anymore. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152090:	  the only lock screen that works on my Galaxy S4. the only problem is it usually unlocked automatically in my pocket 
com.achep.acdisplay#152093:	   I used to use this app all the time, but the media widget stopped working. I researched it and it seems to be a problem many are having, but I haven't seen any updates to fix it. Will change my review once it's fixed. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152096:	   This app is actually better than Motorola's native implementation. Unfortunately, I can't get active mode to work on my Droid Turbo 2. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152097:	   Its awesome but. Its unstable returns to the default locker bugs needed to be fixed. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152101:	   love the simplicity of this lock screen. it would be super perfect if the music player on the lock screen worked. when im playing music and turn the phone on, the music player doesnt stay for more than a second and it goes straight to the time display. please fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#152112:	   Everything is so subtle and clean. Just one thing, make it more stable for music player. In an instance, I was playing music and in the first time I looked at the screen I saw the toggles of musixmatch player and a blur of the artwork as the background. That was great but I turned the screen of and I turn it back on and everything was back to the clock and the phone's wallpaper. Please fix this because this is one of the best apps. This fix could mean so much. Thank you and I hope you will respond. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152120:	  It's OK, but it doesn't work that well with my rooted N5 
com.achep.acdisplay#152121:	   Music were stopping in the background. When i start using this app, i cant play music when i locked it. Can u fix this in the next update please 
com.achep.acdisplay#152122:	  I like it but i seem to experience some type of bug or something. When i recieve a text notification, when my phone is set to silent, it constantly turns on and off the screen until i check or dismiss the notification. Is it the texting app i use? Is it something in the settings that i need to check or uncheck? Or is it simply a bug? would really appreciate a responses. My battery sometimes drains because of this problem... I use a Samsung Galaxy S6 Active. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152124:	   It's great, but I can't use it as it has no security what so ever 
com.achep.acdisplay#152130:	  Needs some bug fixing 
com.achep.acdisplay#152134:	   But everytime I press the + button to add a widget the app crashes. Pls fix. Thx 
com.achep.acdisplay#152135:	   This app is awesome and all but there are some problems like lockscreen remove it from the status bar and add some security and sometimes the notification will stay there it won't close so I have to reboot and add music player option like notification and then it will be worth 5 star I would rate it 5 starssss 
com.achep.acdisplay#152138:	  Please take care of the messages that flicker,ones that give balance information and other similar information. It looks dirty on ac display. I will give 5 star for fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#152142:	   The app failed to work. Lockscreen activated 5 seconds after reawakening my screen. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152148:	    way to much please fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#152154:	  Not working confirmed 
com.achep.acdisplay#152156:	   Its decent, if you have notifications to the point where it is on the bottom row just unlock you're phone because there is no way to dismiss those notifications. Along with that if you play music the lockscreen will all of a sudden dissapear. Although you can solve the problem by opening the app, it's pretty stupid to always have to open the app when I'm listening to music. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152159:	  really awesome. near perfect. the only thing that bothers me is the notification that can't sync with the one from the system (stays on lockscreen when I have dismissed it on notification bar) . is it possible to do it in 4.2.2 or it need at least 4.3? 
com.achep.acdisplay#152162:	  Lock screen is not working fine 
com.achep.acdisplay#152163:	  LG G4 , Whenever I try to add a new widget it crashes. Any fixes for this? 
com.achep.acdisplay#152175:	  Doesn't work 
com.achep.acdisplay#152183:	  Still can't use it. I really want to use this in my 4.2.2 android phone. Please fix it. Thank you! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152185:	  The material design is really nice but please add the lockscreen security and also when in lockscreen if i press the home button the lockscreen unlocks automatically...please fix this... apart from that this app is nice... 
com.achep.acdisplay#152186:	   But the widgets setting is the problem because its written "widgets" but you can only put a widget, so that's the problem. After all, the app was nice and also add a security pattern or lock pin to make the app secure to the device borrowers. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152197:	   It doesn't really turn on much for some reason, but it's a good lock screen, anyone else having the problem on galaxy s5? 
com.achep.acdisplay#152201:	   2 problems otherwise this app is perfect for a lockscreen - 1. Cannot keep a lock 2. Music player shortcut does not appear on lock screen 
com.achep.acdisplay#152202:	   AcDisplay saves the day! After using ActiveDisplay on custom ROM with my previous phone, switching to a phone without that kind of notification is killing me. AcDisplay working almost all the time. Sure it is not perfect and buggy sometimes because it does not need root privilages, but I love this little app. Keep up the good work! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152203:	   Almost perfect but a small problem. when acdisplay active and lock the screen again,it will flickering the screen then complete lock. My device is LG G4 on lollipop 5.1 
com.achep.acdisplay#152209:	  Doesn't work. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152214:	   Omg god man! This is like literally the closest thing to the moto x ect ect active display! This is incredibly awesome! Smoothly runs on my phone (nexus4).. Do face a few problems with the proximity sensor feature but what the hell! This is one amazing app and no major complains or any defect! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152225:	  I really like this app. I like the simple/minimalist design. Only problem is when I set timers regardless of the timer/clock app, AcDisplay stops them from making any sound. They show up in the notification but no sound. No problem with alarms, just timers. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152227:	   This app deserves a 5 only when it works which is not always but rather intermittently. Sometimes it doesn't work at all, sometimes the notifications don't work etc. Quite frustrating! On reboot some of the functions return, but come on...I won't be rebooting my phone 20 times a day just to have this. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152231:	  After I attend to a notification while my screen is awake and them i lock my screen and unlock it again, that notification still appears on the lockscreen. Plzz fix. Otherwise it is a wonderful and an elegant app. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152239:	  I can't remove it !!! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152244:	   i dont like lockscreen replacements... for this one, i dont see any slightest problem so far :) 
com.achep.acdisplay#152248:	   I Like The app A Lot But the notifications of apps stop showing on the lock screen! Fix this issue nd will giv you five stars definitely!  
com.achep.acdisplay#152251:	  i love this app but there's only one thing that bothers me, when i have a missed call it automatically unlock the phone if you can fix that would be nice 
com.achep.acdisplay#152252:	   Lock screen works great other than the fact that Dynamic Background works hardly at all. Other than that, works perfect. Please fix. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152256:	  Only irritating bug is when in Locksreen mode, a missed call unlocks the phone.. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152263:	  Not working!!!! On my gionee it doesn't work 
com.achep.acdisplay#152264:	   This app has more potential than any I've ever seen. This has the capability of becoming one of the best third party lock screens out there.... But it's just too laggy. There are far too many problems. 25% of the time, it doesn't even open and my stock lockscreen takes over. And don't even get me started about when I try to play music. To conclude, I think this app has the potential to be the fastest, most practical lockscreen out there, but it simply isn't written to perfection yet. One day... 
com.achep.acdisplay#152272:	  On LGG4 w/Lollipop 5.1. It has a lot of potential. Like others, I've found several bugs that compromise security. I am sure developer will update soon. One recommendation: it would be great if the lockscreen option would actually lock phone after a set lock timer, then a numerical code, pattern code or tap code (LG G4) could be used to unlock after swiping the AcDisplay screen. For periods of time under the lock timer, the screen would simply timeout and as usual and user would be able to wake the phone by swiping on the AcDisplay screen. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152274:	   Just Add  And ill Give You five Star And Fix The Bugs 
com.achep.acdisplay#152278:	   Yeah. That's the problem, the chat head shows on top of lockscreen, it'll look neat if that doesn't happen. Or should I hide messenger notifications? 
com.achep.acdisplay#152285:	   It looks amazing and this is why this bugs me so much, when you power on the phone, you see the lock screen and just a tap of the home button unlocks the app, it is very annoying and it should be a fixed lockscreen 
com.achep.acdisplay#152286:	  best. but many bug and little lag please improve more and add more fuction. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152288:	   The notifications doesn't get dismissed even after you viewd the notification you have to dismiss it manually 
com.achep.acdisplay#152305:	  Please remove this problem if when a press the home button in Samsung device it will automatically unlock please solve this problem otherwise it is a good app 
com.achep.acdisplay#152306:	  Bug 
com.achep.acdisplay#152314:	  Very elegant and handy. The only bug I've found so far is that tapping on the notification content won't open the linked app if there's more than one notification. Or at least that's what happens with whatsapp. Other than that, wonderful app 
com.achep.acdisplay#152316:	  Pretty great lock screen replacement. The only thing that I wish would be on it is the capability to auto restart if the process bugs out due to memory problems. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152319:	   The constant "AcDisplay services active mode, lockscreen" bar from the notifications panel when the screen is awake. Also the weather icon - I already have one! Can't disable yours. Please fix! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152327:	   This is a great app. Have been looking for something like for quite some time now. This shows what you need to know, who sent what and when. Update: seems to have some issue with Marshmallow. Sometimes the notification text is blank even if you press the icon. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152328:	   Keeps disabling notification permission, so I am constantly having to read activate it. Fix that and it will be a great lock screen. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152335:	   Facebook messnger keeps popping up over the lockscreen though. Fix that and 5 stars for you! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152340:	   However wave to wake and timer on lock screen not working on mi4i. a bit of a let down. Please give me a fix asap.. I love this soo much.. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152350:	  Why does it always go into dark background mode every time a notification arrives? If it's a setting I'm missing, please do tell.. If it's a bug, well let's just say it's very annoying.. deal breaker.. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152361:	   This lockscreen works nicely and looks great but the only downside is when im on the locksrcreen and press the home button my phone will unlock and go to the homescreen so it defeats the purpose of being able to swipe to unlock:/ Please look into this problem otherwise the locksreen is nice:) 
com.achep.acdisplay#152365:	   I already granted its Xposed Module request, the accessibility for notifications ad the device administration request. When pressing the power button, it keeps on rebooting, starting on the boot animation. And it goes continuously. Please fix this. I love the app. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152373:	  Phone was not working properly because of this app 
com.achep.acdisplay#152376:	   It's the best alternative to Moto Active Display. Although motion sensor does not work as in Moto X Play but still it's good. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152382:	   There's no way to stop it from unlocking when the home button is double tapped. Also it crashes when I try to add widgets 
com.achep.acdisplay#152383:	   This is an excellent lockscreen app. Spotify music controls fixed. 5stars! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152394:	   I loved the look of it on my phone a simple black lock screen and I can add colors if I wanted but since I've had it I've noticed my phone auto locking itself now I uninstalled and I'm seeing if I have the same issue hopefully not as I have a brand new s6 edge plus and I don't like my phone auto locking itself quite as often as it did 
com.achep.acdisplay#152399:	   Using rocket player, the previous and next track icons toggle volume up and volume down instead. Any fix for this? 
com.achep.acdisplay#152400:	  ISSUE! All notifications are shown except for Facebook notifications. Please fix!! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152401:	   4 stars? Y? Because when I pause music, and wait the 10 second and dissappear, please fix this and add some security passwords like that bla blah blah... I hope u read this 
com.achep.acdisplay#152407:	   This lockscreen replacer is probably the best one on the play store regarding design. The flat, slightly material design look of it gives it an android feel, since most others focus on ios designs. However... The only problem I can find with this lockscreen is how annoying it is to interact with music when having my phone locked. Sometimes the play/pause icon doesn't change when clicked and everything is really slugish, takes a while to react when pausing/playing. I would really like to see this fixed. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152408:	   Nice app,but please include custom wallpaper selection, and i am facing sleep of death issue with this app.my device working well with stock lockscreen.please fix this ASAP 
com.achep.acdisplay#152411:	  Not in my HTC desire816g fix it plzz 
com.achep.acdisplay#152412:	   First gmail notification causes my S6 to reboot and start in a messed up colour scheme. Distortion blocked colours like the graphics card failed. Not a present experience 
com.achep.acdisplay#152413:	   Some of the wigdet are more bigger than the height and width you alloted please increase the width and height by 0.75cm or i have to uninstall it .and when i press the home button the ac display disappear wtf please fix this issue 
com.achep.acdisplay#152414:	   Sometime the wave gesture works great other times it takes a sec to come up and very rarely it doesn't work at all other than that I love it. :) 
com.achep.acdisplay#152422:	   Except, doesn't work well with Meizu. The wallpaper gets blurred right after wake up. Can you fix that please? 
com.achep.acdisplay#152423:	   The 1 and only problem I have with this app is it opens up the whole messenger app. So I get text pull phone out of pocket and phone lights up the lil text icon.....(so far everything's awesome) then I tap that icon and see message with a reply button....(again still awesome) so I tap reply and small lil messenger box appears while I'm still on lockscreen (still awesome) I type message and hit send button and as soon as I hit send it opens up the whole messenger app (noooooooooo!!!!!) I 
com.achep.acdisplay#152428:	   Im using lg g2 with stock lollipop and dynamic background isn't worked. Back when i had it in kitkat it works flawless. Dunno why but any fix will be much appreciated 
com.achep.acdisplay#152432:	  Waving your hand across the screen does not open the app. I have tried it several times on my Galaxy Note 5 with no luck. That's one option that I had loved about the Moto X was their active screen. You could just wave your hand across the screen and the time, date and any messages would appear on the screen. I thought that that is was this app was suppose to do, but I can't seem to get it to work. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152434:	   The lockscreen doesn't work whenever I press the power on off button 
com.achep.acdisplay#152438:	   Softkeys show up on htc one m8 while swiping from bottom left or right. Few bugs here and there but great concept 
com.achep.acdisplay#152440:	   Also when tried to uninstalled it doesn't let you or clear default if it wasn't for my antivirus i wouldn't find a way to uninstalled this app. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152454:	   What a joke, man? Why not making something that is tide on security, does not bug? Most of the security app bug so easily like this one! Cannot even put your own wallpaper man. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152468:	   I really want to like this. Since my 1st gen Moto X died, I decided to get the Galaxy S6, and very much missed this feature. Everything works well, but Android Pay now forces you to have a security lock. So now i have to put in a PIN then I'm taken to Ac Display. Its now more of a hassle to use. Until they fix this, I'll just need to dream of my last phone.... 
com.achep.acdisplay#152483:	   It's very good, though I've noticed a little bug. If I press the home button on the ac display lockscreen, it opens the default lockscreen. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152485:	   The group notifications are not opened as smoothly as individual chats 
com.achep.acdisplay#152493:	   It makes my phone mess up like crazy with Spotify. And I can't pause music playing from Spotify at the lockscreen 
com.achep.acdisplay#152501:	   The active mode isn't working, I enabled it and when I turn my phone over, the screen isn't turning on 
com.achep.acdisplay#152510:	  Pls don't download this app 
com.achep.acdisplay#152511:	   Nice but in my phone sms and misscall not showing. Please fix. Tq 
com.achep.acdisplay#152514:	   App is good love what it made to do but why I can't see my lockscreen thts my only problem plz help..it directly takes me to my Home screen 
com.achep.acdisplay#152518:	   Doesn't work for me most time once it sleeps it didnt wake up again 
com.achep.acdisplay#152523:	  Having issues even just using the app because of notifications that doesn't teach how to bypass. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152525:	   When trying to add new widgets, the app crashes and returns to the home screen 
com.achep.acdisplay#152527:	  Whenever i press my physical home button nd recent apps button, it unlocks the phone. Can you please look into this bug because i really love this app.. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152528:	   The best one have used. Simple. But not so smooth now. If there is a carrier notification on home screen and if its not removed and screen is turned off and then on again. the app responds abnormally making the ac display lock screen blink continuously. Also if we are able to choose custom background instead of black or homescreen,it would be great! Down rated..fix the bug. would love to rate 5 stars then. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152529:	   The wave feature thing doesn't work for me 
com.achep.acdisplay#152532:	   On my lg g3 it won't let it snooze. I woke up an hour later today because of it. I thought I might be wrong so I tested it again and it just won't let it snooze. Please fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#152535:	   Music controls not working with Spotify 
com.achep.acdisplay#152536:	   Whenever any noification comes ,the screen fluctuats frequently... Pls fix it in next update.. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152538:	   Settings kept crashing when trying to add a custom widget on LG G3. Asked dev to fix and was told it was an LG bug and to "Flash custom AOSP-based ROM" which is a pretty lazy response and not practical for the average user. Uninstalled. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152544:	   Great app all around, except for when I unlock the screen, in which case it has been auto-locking again after a couple seconds, really annoying. *update* the bugs are out of control, they were causing a huge problem on my device, and I couldn't stand to have it installed (made my phone slow, laggy, constantly crashing, and prevented the key board from popping up). Please fix these bugs and I would be happy to download again 
com.achep.acdisplay#152547:	   Excellent app, works perfectly in giving a very clean, consistent, minimal lock screen. Just one tiny issue, lock screen gets disabled altogether after an alarm. Please fix. Nevertheless, still deserves 5 stars. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152548:	   The unlock animation was smoother. When I unlock the white screen with the lock icon stays up for a second or 2 and it get annoy especially at night causes it hurts ur eyes. Please fix and then I will give a higher rating. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152552:	   For some reason every time I unlock my lg g4 with ac display I wait a couple of seconds after I unlock and I must unlock it a second time. Please fix because I loved this app until it started to do this. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152553:	  home button override locker no work around 
com.achep.acdisplay#152560:	    is too long, like 5sec pls fix it 
com.achep.acdisplay#152561:	   It works really well but it does have bugs. When you a view a notification from the lockscreen sometimes it completely bypasses the lockscreen which is a serious security flaw for the phone. If that was fixed this would be a great app!! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152562:	   gives me an error saying usage stats need to avoid phone apps and alarms bit it's a tablet and I have no alarms set 
com.achep.acdisplay#152564:	  Cannot deactivate or uninstall, okay so this app first of all didn't worked out for me and now when I want to uninstall it, I can't. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152565:	   The activate display was probably my favorite feature from my old Moto X. When I upgraded, I felt like something was missing, and this instantly fixed the problem! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152566:	   But it eats through my battery like termites through wood. Please fix, otherwise great app. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152573:	   It do not work in my Mi 4i with MIUI 
com.achep.acdisplay#152577:	   heads up notifications are displayed on lockscreen please fix this other wise everything works like a charm 
com.achep.acdisplay#152585:	   When a alarm rings the power button or the volume button doesn't work .... 1st unlock and the dismiss the alarm ... Fix it .... Ever things else fine thanks for the awesome app 
com.achep.acdisplay#152587:	   I absolutely love this lock screen! Stopped using and just came back to it. However, I can across one issue. The media buttons do not work when using Spotify and work every now and then in Google Music. If you could fix it would be perfect! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152589:	   Seems like lightning n shivering cannot be used, useful only pre lollipop please rectify the bug so it can be used. It is excellent app but cannot use. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152594:	   I loved this app on my note 3, but force closes when I attempt to add a custom widget. Emailed the developer weeks ago with no response. Upset I payed for an app that doesn't work. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152597:	   On Galaxy Note 5, having issues with it not coming active while screen is off. So essentially, it is doing absolutely nothing. :( it WAS working, now suddenly it doesnt. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152606:	   Its a nice app good minimalistic and all but there is virtually no way to uninstall this price of crap. Fix this and I ll give 5 
com.achep.acdisplay#152620:	   I just can't seem to get widgets working, every time I open the widget settings it crashes. Everything else is sweet though. Edit: looks like this us a known issue for the lg g3. Too bad! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152629:	   Good app.. But older notifications which are read out earlier, reappear on the lock screen. And disappear only after clearing it.. Which is very annoying.. Please fix it.. Otherwise very good app.. Waiting for reply 
com.achep.acdisplay#152642:	   The only issue nowadays is that dynamic backgrounds isn't working properly. No art for any notifications is working including music. Please fix as it is one of the things I love the most about AC display 
com.achep.acdisplay#152662:	   Please fix wave to wake feature. Does not wake up the screen in one go... And one more problem, whenever I'm using my phone, receives a notification and clears it at that instant it does not sync up with that. It shows the cleared notification after the lock is set! So plsss u have some work to do... 
com.achep.acdisplay#152668:	   It crashes as soon as i try to launch it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152670:	  Media player doesn't work 
com.achep.acdisplay#152672:	   Please fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#152676:	   Absolutely love it. Except for Spotify Music controls that don't work. Other than I would be satisfied and proud to be using this great lock screen on my G4 
com.achep.acdisplay#152677:	  Plz don't use dis app 
com.achep.acdisplay#152684:	   Media widget is not working anymore for me.. Cant pause/backward/forward music unless unlocking and go into app which is boring... When fixed... Going straight for 5* 
com.achep.acdisplay#152686:	  A lot of potential, but some major issues on my phone. LG G3 on Lollipop 5.0.1. I can't add a custom widget. Every time I try, I get "unfortunately, settings has stopped." Please fix this!! Or at least give the option to move the clock to a different part of the screen. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152688:	   A nice and clean lockscreen with a cool unlock animation. Only problem I have with this is that there is no PIN feature. Other lockscreen apps have them, but don't look as great and minimalistic as this one. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152693:	   You need to fix the glitch with the  music controls, every other music app seems to work except . 
com.achep.acdisplay#152695:	   App is good but have some problem with lockscreen in Android lolipop. When screen is locked and some USSD message received, on screen wakeup lockscreen flickers(fluctuates). Issue is specific to Android lolipop version. It was working proper on Android kitkat. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152697:	  loving the experience so fa. only concern is that alarms arent ringing no matter what options im trying. please fix :) (running on HTC one max stock 5.0) 
com.achep.acdisplay#152700:	   Love the app, super clean and lightweight! BUT.. Spotify music controls don't work on the lockscreen at all. Please fix this, then 5 stars! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152705:	   I used this all the time with KitKat and had no reservations at all. When I upgraded to Lollipop though, I've run into a lot of problems. It will no longer let me drag down the notification shade on lock screen anymore which is really irritating as well as it often just doesn't launch. Sometimes the screen will constantly turn itself on if there's a notification sitting there. Screen will time out and then pop back on eternally until you dismiss it. Unfortunate that this isn't as good on the new OS. :( 
com.achep.acdisplay#152711:	   its ok until i switched to lollipop then spotify media buttons won't work on this lockscreen. Using Samsung Galaxy Note 3 
com.achep.acdisplay#152715:	   I've been using AcDisplay for a long time now. It handles notifications simply and smoothly, right out of the box, but now has plenty of customization options available (esp. custom widgets) The only problem I've encountered so far is the occasional non-responsive media controls, but I'm sure they'll be fixed soon. Thanks, dev! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152719:	   It needs some more works in terms of bug fixes and workability, it's waking up by motion isn't working at all, after one wake up screen only for clock and notification check out in second trying the main system lockscreen will came up instead! There's new (I guess) feather in lollipop, trust agents, I think developers could use it to bypass main system lockscreen and uses app's own lockscreen by pin or patterns, Itll be awesome if so, Anyway it's a tremendous work but need deep improvement, Keep going! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152720:	   This app is amazing and I like the simplicity. Only problem is there isn't any security options. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152721:	   Using this app for ages, i loved the ability to add Widgets, but massively disappointed now. Doesn't function with Spotify, no lock code, please please please fix. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152725:	   Media widget not working 
com.achep.acdisplay#152726:	   I really love this lockscreen. It's simple and efficient. But for some reason i can't remove the vibrate when i unlock it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152728:	   This is one of the best lockscreens ever yet I can press my home button or back button to bypass it. I will give it a 5 once this is fixed 
com.achep.acdisplay#152731:	  this is such a nice app i ever use, but for me its has a problem that notification is not dismissed automatically where notification is read out. please solve it . i need this apps.. reply me soon i am waiting 
com.achep.acdisplay#152732:	   Notifications work great, but I cannot play or skip songs with Spotify. I could with a previous version, but this needs fixed, please. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152733:	   There was an issue regarding my lock screen. It seems that i can't click any stuff when it is in lock screen. I cant change my song in spotify when i open my screen. Please help. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152734:	   I got this for the lock screen and I love it. Only had it for a day though. The only issue I have is that when the lock screen is active, I can hit the home button and it unlocks. That shouldn't happen. And there's no setting to change it. That fix would bump my rating to 5 stars. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152736:	   The unlock animation isn't working properly on my S6 running lollipop. Other than the bugs it's awesome!! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152738:	   Great app, but too unstable for every day use. Media controls did not work at all with Spotify and lock screen crashed several times per day under normal use. Will keep my eye on it and try again after stability increases. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152743:	   Please fix this. What's the point of using a lockscreen when you can press home button to unlock 
com.achep.acdisplay#152749:	   The app continues to crash all the time after android 5.0.1 upgrade. . Please fix the issue and the app will get 5 stars once again. I've sent many crash reports - the app flickers when a message comes in and then crashes. Still experiencing crashes and note 4 freezes.... 8/15/2015 - unfortunately I am no longer using this app due to the constant freezing and locking up of my note 4 when receiving txt msg or calls. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152750:	   The active mode, though really useful, puts a huge strain on the battery. Please fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#152751:	   The home button still closes AcDisplay when it's set as phone's lock screen. please fix it on the next update! thanks! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152756:	  This app don't work for my lg g2! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152769:	  App is frequently restarting and consuming too much battery....is there any way to fix it...please help... I really like this app 
com.achep.acdisplay#152770:	   I love the  feature but most times it doesn't work. Can you add settings to the proximity sensor? 
com.achep.acdisplay#152773:	   give an option to use the lollipop style unlocking instead of swipe anywhere. I plugged in my headphones to listen to music and the app went beserk, it would show my music controls but they didn't work, no song info or time was shown, it works fine without headphones though 
com.achep.acdisplay#152775:	  Waking up of screen after taking phone out of pocket and wave to unlock has some problems, other than that the App is Awesome :D 
com.achep.acdisplay#152782:	   The app is nice. I enjoy the sleek look it brings to the table; a nice change of scenery from the stock lock screen. however, it's a little irksome to me that the screen unlocks just by pressing my home button while the display is on. I also seldom experience an issue with the screen display coming back on just after dimming once a notification has been shown and no action taken. any way to fix these issues? Then you're golden! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152784:	   Updated to lollipop. Removed the option to set 'none' as lock screen. Unable to enable lock screen or see a display in any way. When trying to enable permissions, it just takes me to main settings page. Might just be a problem on Samsung's behalf. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152793:	  Fix it from automatically snoozing my alarm and it would get 5-stars 
com.achep.acdisplay#152797:	   everything else seems to be fine, but the music controls do not work anymore. EDIT: are you guys going to create some type of security with this lock screen? 
com.achep.acdisplay#152798:	   Every time I set an alarm the app won't let me open my phone, after the alarm stop I cant touch my phone anymore. Please fix it, this app is really nice. thanks. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152808:	  Really good app. But there is one problem. Even after reading the notifications, it always show notification on display. I have to swipe down every notification every time. Pls do something for this. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152813:	   During the previous update, which was buggier than a rain forest, I HAD to use a different lockscreen. Let me tell you something: worst days my phone ever had to go through. I'm glad you fixed the bugs, this app is legit the best lockscreen app ever. Don't release any buggy updates in the future please!!! Lol 
com.achep.acdisplay#152820:	   The pause/play and the nect/previous track buttons don't work anymore and I've tried with Spotify and Google play 
com.achep.acdisplay#152826:	  The idea of the app is nice but i have some issues with the app. Maybe they are specific for my device (LG G4) but i am not sure i will keep using the app if it won't be fixed. For example, Any alarm i have, starts and immediately moves to snooze, another issue with the alarm is that it's not shown over the 'acdisplay' so you need to unlock in order to see it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152828:	  App does not work on LG LEON LTE which defeats the purpose of this app. uninstalling if i can somehow i can not access DEACTIVATE thing. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152833:	   Like shaking images of ac display and my background on my moto g ( 2nd ) generation please fix . 
com.achep.acdisplay#152834:	  Can't control Spotify and Netflix from the screen anymore. Any chance to fix? 
com.achep.acdisplay#152837:	   Please fix the bug whereby the home button bypasses the lock screen. It is the most pleasant looking lockscreen I've use 'out of the box' so far. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152838:	   It impressed me as well as my friends! One thing though, it unlockes when you press the home button of your phone when you read a notification, please fix that :) then it should be a factory app for all smartphones 
com.achep.acdisplay#152840:	  gets worse with every update. it still does its job but updates should not remove features, only add new ones. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152842:	   Happy that the update fixed my problem. Thank you for hearing me out, devs. This app has endless possibilities. Than you for hearing us out peoplr who is still running an  smartphone. More powers! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152843:	   Minimalistic and beautiful, this fulfills all I want in a lock screen. 4 stars because it misses one point, locking. I couldn't find any way to put a password of some kind, and I would really appreciate if you'll add it. Great app overall; 
com.achep.acdisplay#152845:	   I've loved this app for a long time but the problem I've been having for a while the music controls don't work on my galaxy s4 with android 5.0.1 pleas fix ASAP 
com.achep.acdisplay#152852:	   Working beautifully again, thanks for the prompt response and fix, great app great dev 
com.achep.acdisplay#152856:	    for Spotify aren't working. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152858:	   Fixed. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152861:	   But like every other lock screen notification app I've tried, it doesn't respect the smart Lock feature of lollipop. When connected to an authorized smart device, it still auto locks the phone. 1st lock screen app to fix this gets my money. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152863:	   This app is not bad but it will not let me uninstall which is causing a huge issue on my phone. It is blinking and flashing. This is a HUGE issue and it needs to be resolved immediately. I went to the play store to uninstall this app and it has been HOURS since I did that and it still says it is" uninstalling". Do not install this app until this issue is fixed! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152865:	   While it may not be a bad app, it just didn't suit my needs. When I tried to uninstall, it wouldn't give me the option. I tried to go into my application manager and the option to uninstall was greyed out. So... I then went back to the App Store to uninstall and it's been 10 minutes and still saying uninstalling. Very frustrating so I think the developers should check on this issue. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152868:	   Ram usage goes 86mb to 400 or even 500+ mb through the day. Once it hits the 400-500mb zone it never goes back down. The only way to fix is to wait for the process is kill itself or to reboot the phone. Nexus 5 running 4.4.4. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152872:	   No longer usable with Nova launcher. Crashes directly after enabling the lock screen and after this the home button no longer works at all. Reinstalling didn't help. @Samsung S4 
com.achep.acdisplay#152875:	   Didn't work as a lock screen for my  m7. It would only appear when I had pending notifications. Please help/fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#152877:	   Everything works great, except there should an option to block the home button. Pressing the home button on my  bypasses the whole lockscreen and brings me to the homescreen of my phone directly! The other bug is that the chat heads appear on the lockscreen as well. This should be fixed as early as possible cuz this thing is already bugging me a lot. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152879:	  doesn't work with note 4 
com.achep.acdisplay#152881:	   Latest update still does not work right. The first time I select the notification icon I see the preview. But if I press it again all I get is a blank screen. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152885:	   Great app amazing design. After using for some time a few additions can be considered. 1. Swiping from corners you have to give us an option to pick any app installed. 2. Might be good idea to give option to change the swype distance for unlocking. In my previous screen lock it was may be 2 times shorter yet the phone never unlocked itself. 3. Active mode didn't work at all on 2 asus and Alcatel phones that I tried. May be good idea to give some testing option with some settings to tweak. Thanks 
com.achep.acdisplay#152886:	   But sometime it do not open my phone on waving 
com.achep.acdisplay#152890:	   The app bypass lock screen on pressing home button... Please fix it.. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152892:	   Can you please fix the physical home button bypass. When the device is locked you can press the home button and the lockscreen is rendered useless. Would be a perfect app If this issue could be fixed. Love the way you can view notifications. Great job! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152893:	  After viewing the message and I press back button,i will not get to the home page but the acdisplay page.older version don't have this problem 
com.achep.acdisplay#152895:	  fix the media player and it will be an easy 5 stars. love the app. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152899:	  Love the simple looks. Sometimes stop working on my device though. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152901:	   Was fantastic, now double tapping doesn't turn the screen off at all! And notification bar is still there no matter what! Fix that 
com.achep.acdisplay#152904:	   This is my go-to lock screen app but since the last updated it's not working at all. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152905:	   And add some patterns, pin lock so it can be secured so i don't need my built in lock pin or pattern... Pls fix it, because its simple, minimal, fast and smooth animations.. So pls fix it, i really like it. If you do, then I'll give you five stars :)) 
com.achep.acdisplay#152907:	   I can't delete it I've tried turninig it off and denying it notification access. I can't get rid of it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152911:	   Please do not fix something that is not broken 
com.achep.acdisplay#152912:	  App worked great until the latest update... I don't know what happened, but here are some of the issues I've noticed with this update: 1. The grey bar which indicates how much time is left before going back to sleep does not move/shrink at all anymore. 2. My phone won't go back to sleep at all. 3. Double tapping to sleep no longer works. 4. Sending a Test Notification does nothing but put the phone into ACDisplay lockscreen with no notification (even after manually turning off the display). 5. When the display is on and displaying the ACDisplay lockscreen, a new notification immediately puts the devise to sleep. 6. When I select a notification icon and slide it up to open the application, there is no haptic feedback. Please fix/help. In the mean time, I am going to see if I have an older copy to roll back to 
com.achep.acdisplay#152913:	   I like this idea but it just won't work. .. screen does not come on 
com.achep.acdisplay#152914:	   not working on xperia M2 
com.achep.acdisplay#152916:	   There is only a single problem with this app.. When operator's message arrives..the acdisplay screen starts blinking..plz solve it asap 
com.achep.acdisplay#152923:	   My journey with this app has been a rollercoaster. Every update, while seemingly fixing previous bugs, just creates other bugs. I really love this app and want to continue to use it but it's just not functional. It freezes up and closes randomly. Music controls DO NOT WORK with Spotify. Shows album art but cannot change or pause song. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152924:	   1) The media widget on the lock screen that controls music play back and the double tap to sleep option are both nonfunctional. 2) There doesn't appear to be an option for the lock screen to remain on when music is being played or while charging. It even seems to override this option I have associated with another app. 3) An option to display or not display the status bar on the lock screen would be a desirable feature. Nice app, but the same issues exist even after a year following my initial review. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152926:	   The app is really good by doing the same thing as the Moto X. The only problem is that every time I update, it doesn't tell me what is new in the update 
com.achep.acdisplay#152931:	   Terrible doesn't work at all it just does nothing it didn't replace the lock screen. I gave it administrative permissions still nothing. Restarted my device and still nothing. In short don't get this app and definitely don't donate! 
com.achep.acdisplay#152942:	   Only displays music album artwork half the time the other half it shows regular acdisplay lockscreen. Please fix for 5 stars 
com.achep.acdisplay#152946:	   Make sure that you want this app on your phone once its on there you cannot get rid of it 
com.achep.acdisplay#152947:	   I don't know if im missing something or what but its not working on my samsung galaxy s5. Im already on lollipop. Please help me work it on my phone. I really want to use this. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152953:	  The app is not working with LG G3 Lollipop. I disabled the System lock,gave Admin privileges, enabled ACDisplay and nothing happens. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152958:	   I love this app, and it really adds a nice touch to unlocking my phone and managing the many notifications. My only issue is that the lock screen doesn't shut off the home button, and I'd love for that to be a feature soon so that my phone doesn't unlock in my pocket because I bumped my thigh into a corner or something. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152961:	   Whenever I get notifications the screen doesn't turn off. Even if I push the power key to turn it off it comes back on a second later. Please fix this 
com.achep.acdisplay#152964:	   the double tap to turn the screen off, does not work. Was wondering if that could be fixed...... And the notifications dont wake up the screen... Please fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#152966:	  Does what it says. Like its Minimalist design. I would have given it 5 star if the Home button is disabled. Also, sometimes music controls are lost and notification does not open after swiping up. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152968:	   Please fix it. I really want this lockscreen. It's one of the best that i've seen so far. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152970:	   I cannot delete it from my phone and its device administrative option ain't working 
com.achep.acdisplay#152971:	   I enjoyed and used this app for 3 days before uninstalling it. The reason being I get notifs for apps for which I have already seen them that too before locking. petty issue it is. I hope you will fix it. and why did you ask for xposed integration ? 
com.achep.acdisplay#152972:	  Wave to wake can use some improvements (doesn't work on moto g and works 2/5 on oneplus one) and sometimes my default Lockscreen pops up (android l) and I have to unlock that one first and then unlock the acdisplay one next. Overall works great though. Wouldn't want to use another Lockscreen. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152976:	   Not working 
com.achep.acdisplay#152982:	   I have the app turned but it just takes me back to my original lockscreen plz fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#152983:	   Have LG G3. Often have to unlock twice to get to the home screen. Fix this and five stars. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152986:	  It doesn't work as expected when there is more than one row of notifications in he lock screen. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152995:	   After the update the full screen mode and double tap to sleep features are not working. I also tried uninstall & reinstalling the app but it didn't helped. I hope they will fix this issue as soon as possible. 
com.achep.acdisplay#152998:	  Stopped working after 7/12 update 
com.achep.acdisplay#153001:	  just add pin code, and fix when double tap home button it exit 
com.achep.acdisplay#153020:	  Issues with wynk music app.. Stops responding and crashes occasionally 
com.achep.acdisplay#153021:	   The lock screen looks neat, clean and simple. But it most definitely needs security options such as passwords, pins and/or patterns. Another bug is that when pressing the home button you're directed to the home screen and I believe that should be solved by having a security option enabled. Thanks for the nice app. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153022:	   First in the actual lockscreen when I long press the home button/recent app it show the recent panel and the lockscreen gone.. Second there always a notification in my notification panel that the app is on service. Please do something to fix it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153033:	   Thanks Guys for this awsome app. Its so Clean and dynamic. Really love it but i face 3 problem with it. 1. facebook messenger chat head also open in lock screen and msg can see without unlocking it. 2. In Notification panel AcDisplay Services always open. If it not there then it look great or you guys add some cool feature like Android device running time or like this. then if its there everybody love to have this. 3. When i am on Active mode it works 2 or 4 time and then phone shoutdown autometically. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153043:	   This is THE best looking app, but i find that if i press my home button, it opens the locker, bug or supposed to be in the app? 
com.achep.acdisplay#153044:	   Good lockscreen, but it needs better security options. Currently there are no options for a pin code or a fingerprint scanner, and there is a large gap in security. Simply press the home button on the lock screen and it will take you to the homescreen. I hope this will be fixed soon enough and further options for security will be implemented. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153049:	   no le doy 5 estrellas porque cuando hay un error del sistema se queda titilando la pantalla. Pero de resto es excelente, ojala se acerquen m a la glance screen de los lunia 
com.achep.acdisplay#153054:	   Nice but sometimes i cannot open the notification and only can clear it. Pls fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#153067:	   Would be great if you could fix the lock screen getting completely ignored when you push the home button 
com.achep.acdisplay#153069:	   All in all the app is fantabulous but there is a major bug in it that u can bypass the lockscreen easily by pressing home button...plz fix this ASAP for 5* 
com.achep.acdisplay#153075:	  I wanted to love it, and I did at first, until I realized it couldn't actually be a real lock screen. If I could use this to secure my phone I'd give it 5 stars. Also, active mode doesn't work for me and adding a widget crashes the entire app. LG G4 
com.achep.acdisplay#153080:	   There's a bug where when there's a notification, the screen will keep turning on until it is dismissed. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153083:	   I'm not even sure what this app supposedly does besides the minimal lock screen but the persistent notification is so unnecessary. It irritated me to the point of uninstall. I know it's some new android rule but it's a stupid rule and I don't use apps that follow it, too annoying. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153086:	  Very decent app.only problem is when added a custom clock widget it is freezes at times. I tried several clock widgets but result was same. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153087:	   But recently keeps crashing when playing youtube videos on the background 
com.achep.acdisplay#153091:	   I love the concept of this app, but can't use it because of two problems. First when you set for the phone to wake on a notification the timer has to run out and the screen has to wake up for a second time by itself or manually for the notification to trigger on the screen which leads into my second problem the screen wakes up by itself until the notification is dismissed using a ridiculous amount of battery I would love to start using the app again but can't at this time 
com.achep.acdisplay#153099:	   I really love this, very useful to see any notification when pick a device out of pocket without press any button, Thanks developer!!!... but please add motion wake up after putting device flatly or not move device for a while by using accelerometer sensor or gyroscope like what on moto x. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153103:	   I would rate it 5 stars but because I have a galaxy when i m on The lock screen I could press the home button and it would go straight to the home screen and I would get really annoyed please fix it or make it not bypass the lock screen and I would rate it 5 stars 
com.achep.acdisplay#153107:	   This app is one of the best and is what I've been looking for but one problem is that whenever I have a notification my LED light doesn't work so I don't know if I have a notification or not until I wake up my device. if this was made to work then it would fully deserve 5 stars 
com.achep.acdisplay#153109:	  Awesome app! Love it. However since update to android L 5.1 AcDisplay no longer working properly, notifications are hit & miss! Please fix issue with Android L. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153137:	   Screen locks by itself from time to time and it also force closes quite a lot. Would come back and rate 5 if these were fixed though. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153141:	   The only down side on this great lockscreen for me is that you can bypass it by pressing the home button, i'd greatly appreciate it if you were to fix this even though it's not a major issue :p thanks anyway! 
com.achep.acdisplay#153146:	   fix this pls 
com.achep.acdisplay#153151:	   It suffers from the same problems all lockscreen apps do... It's basically just an overlay ontop of the existing lockscreen and I understand the issues with replacing the actual stock lockscreen, but still tho good job to the devs. Keep up support for this great app 
com.achep.acdisplay#153152:	   BEFORE I USED THIS APP, IT ASKED TO READ ALL OF MY PERSONAL INFORMATION SUCH AS READING MY MESSAGES AND SEEING PHOTOS SENT TO ME. I'M NOT DOWNLOADING THIS... IF YOU DO YOUR STUPID 
com.achep.acdisplay#153159:	   I have the 2013 Google Nexus 7 and I love the app overall. It looks great, it's simple, sleek, and smooth. But ever since I enabled the lock screen and active display, my tablet screen will not rotate to landscape, it constantly stays in portrait. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153165:	   It looks great but every once in a while it doesn't display my notifications or simply doesn't work at all. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153167:	   Ever since i updated my htc m7 to android 5.0 i keep having some issues like : when my alarm starts it doesen't bypass the ac display lockscreen so i have to first unlock my phone and then stop or snooze it and i can't pause or skip a song from the lockscreen and that's a bummer because i loved it on kitkat. I really hope for an update! This update was what i was looking for ! Great job! 
com.achep.acdisplay#153171:	   LGG3 on lollipop. There was an update that removed the lock screen option from the settings menu so now it only says active mode. Hope this is fixed as its my favourite lock screen 
com.achep.acdisplay#153175:	   But the HBO media overlay causes it to crash. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153178:	   When I press the home button on my Verizon Galaxy s5, it always goes to my home screen just as it would whilst exiting an app. Please fix this error. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153193:	   Works great in most aspects, however the stock AOSP (Lollipop) alarm-dismiss-screen gets hidden, so I have to swipe twice to dismiss or snooze. A fix for this would be great! 
com.achep.acdisplay#153194:	  Great app bug needs a security feature I.e pin, pattern 
com.achep.acdisplay#153202:	   After I update my S5 to lollipop, acdisplay isnt working. Everytime I lock my device it uses the default lock app of my phone. How can I fix this? Overall it's a great app anyways. Still a 5star for me. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153203:	   After upgrade to 3.7, memory leak problem appears again. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153204:	   The alarms don't get through to the lockscreen an don't make noise either 
com.achep.acdisplay#153205:	  Totally bakawas app don't download this app otherwise it doesn't remove from your mobile...... 
com.achep.acdisplay#153208:	   I love this app since my G3 doesn't light up on notifications as I was used to before coming to Android, and with that it works fine. Sometimes it won't light up on notifications, and when the phone is turned on it goes to the typical lock screen, which bugs me. There is also an option for widgets, but I can't say whether it's good or not because every time I try to add one the app crashes. This really annoys me and if it can be fixed this app will deserve all 5 stars. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153212:	   I've loved this app and used it for some time now. But my only problem is that the system screen timeout always changes back to 15 sec even after I change it manually. This seems to be because of AcDisplay.Please fix it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153213:	   I can't add widgets to the lock screen. Every time I try, it says an there was an error in the settings. Fix this and its perfection 
com.achep.acdisplay#153214:	  Won't work properly on Lollipop, as it takes me to the lockscreen (which displays again the notification I had previously dismissed), besides, it should open the notification when I tap on it, but it doesn't. I believe it has actually something to do with Lollipop itself rather than a bug from the app, it worked flawlessly on KitKat 
com.achep.acdisplay#153223:	   please fix how i can bypass the lockscreen by tapping the home button. also, it's slow on responding to turning my screen on. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153224:	  Fixed it 
com.achep.acdisplay#153231:	   Really nice and a brilliant app but on my lg g3 the app crashes when I try to change the widget and the lock screen only works when I receive a notification (not when I unlock in manually) please fix this or inform me what I'm doing g wrong and it will be 5 stars 
com.achep.acdisplay#153236:	   The lock screen on my samsung s6 can be opened if I press the home button and doesn't need a swipe to unlock. Please fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#153241:	   But, when I open an notification and exit, still it appears on lock screen and I have to manually remove that. Please fix it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153244:	   I loved this thing, but the only thing keeping me from using it anymore is that my home button and other capacitive buttons on my phone will close out of the lock screen or take me out of it. I'm using a note 4, so I'm not sure if this is a phone-specific problem, but it's really bothersome. I love the app, but it's given me so many problems solely due to this issue. Lock all the buttons other than the lock button and volume rocker, and it will be perfect for me. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153250:	   I seem to not be able to get it to work on my GS5 5.0 Lollipop. I have allowed access for AC Display for everything on my phone. Can someone help me out? In the app, i do not have a Lockscreen Option, only a Active Mode Option. Can that be the issue? 
com.achep.acdisplay#153270:	   Settings crashes when trying to put a widget on my lg l90 fix for 5 stars 
com.achep.acdisplay#153276:	   This lockscreen is great, it looks great too. But it just keeps crashing. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153278:	   This is the perfect lockscreen for me, exactly what I was looking for. However, on my HTC One M7, it unlocks when I press the home button. Please fix it ! 
com.achep.acdisplay#153280:	   It's an awesome app for lock screen which can be used for notification also.but from recent update my test notification is not working.but the actual notification works.might wanna see it.using HTC desire820 
com.achep.acdisplay#153283:	  Won't work with lollipop 
com.achep.acdisplay#153287:	   Right now at 90% but could be best app for Android if its worked 100% like moto active display. The sensors don't work well. Most of the time doesn't show the time or notifications when pulled out of the pocket. May be with a little work the developer can create a masterpiece. Please keep working and make this app perfect. People are willing to pay for apps like this. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153292:	   Artwork doesn't work while playing music. Please fix! 
com.achep.acdisplay#153293:	   Looks great, and handles notifications well. But needs some improvements. The wave function doesn't work very well. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153294:	   Many times it freezes and often the notifications are not opened directly from the lockscreen due to some bug 
com.achep.acdisplay#153299:	   I really liked this app.. But few more improvements will make me love it. I'm suggesting few improvements. Hope you find a way to improve.. 1. Lock the buttons 2. Try to erase the notifications which is already seen 3. Try to add security (pattern, pin, etc) and also try to fix minor bugs :D thanks a lot for this app.. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153312:	   My alarm clock doesn't work with this app running, use as lockscreen checked and given device administrator 
com.achep.acdisplay#153321:	   I cannot find active mode feature on my samsung note 10.1 n8000, 3 star for now because of the missing feature. But overall it works very nice. Thx 
com.achep.acdisplay#153322:	   No performance issues at all only reason im giving it 4 stars is cause theres no password for the lockscreen when/if it gets a pin feature i will change to 5 stars 
com.achep.acdisplay#153324:	   Sometimes the clock will not show up on the lock screen if I have music playing. Another minor pet peeve would be that when the screen is unlocked while music is playing, the clock from the lock screen will pop up for a split second. If you could fix these issues it would be greatly appreciated. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153326:	   One problem, if I press home button, it will go to the home screen. Which is annoying. Can you disable hone button? 
com.achep.acdisplay#153332:	   The app is beautiful and runs great however there is one major problem, when I use nexmusic + to play music as soon as the lockscreen activates nexmusic + crashes (it didn't do that with my stock launcher) 
com.achep.acdisplay#153334:	   Everything keeps fine until I try to add widgets. Then the app crashes 
com.achep.acdisplay#153337:	   On my S4, the Menu button is not disable when the screen is locked and everytime I press on it, it unlock my screen - Not Good! This needs to be fixed! 
com.achep.acdisplay#153342:	   Notification icons still appear on the lockscreen though I already dismissed/seen them, or the other way around wherein notifications still appear on my notification bar. Otherwise, it's such a great looking minimalistic app! Please just fix some bugs/problems. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153343:	   The design is amazing, probably the most simple, elegant I've seen in years, however you don't get much personalization and that's fine. My only complain is that the widgets don't work as they should be or it's confusing using them, also the artwork the app gets from other music apps sometimes fails to display, pops 3 seconds and then it turns dark 
com.achep.acdisplay#153344:	   This is a great application, developer responds quickly to issues / bugs :-) 
com.achep.acdisplay#153346:	   It was best app but not working under android Lollipop. Pl fix it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153347:	   First of all beautiful app I've had for about three months but the new widget feature comes up with a pop up saying settings has crashed when you try to add a widget. Also a security feature is becoming something I want on this now. I know that it might not be completely possible due to the full screen/non full screen feature but a way around this should be possible like other lock screens. Otherwise great app and interface 
com.achep.acdisplay#153358:	   Can't use the lock screen due to the usage stats :( 
com.achep.acdisplay#153361:	   Update fixed last issue. Would still like a music widget tho 
com.achep.acdisplay#153370:	  Don't work properly. Can't uninstall from settings/apps and from menu 
com.achep.acdisplay#153375:	   Hands down best notification app I've ever had. I really enjoy this as my lockscreen. I have not had any problems with it and it works great on my Note 3. Nice job dev!  
com.achep.acdisplay#153379:	   Alright This Is Flipping Bugging Me Now Like Beyond Belief And That Problem Is I Don't Care If The Pattern Or Pin Implemented Is Not Secure I Just At least Need A Bit Of Security Because Something Is Better Than Nothing Yes I Know A Pin Can Be Bypassed In Many Ways But Iam Just Saying This Because Anyone Can Go Onto My Phone With ACdisplay But I Love The Lockscreen And Also Please Add A Knock On Feature... Please I Will Love You. +Artem Chepurnoy. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153381:	   Since updating to L acdisplay works once in a blue moon - when I had a notification from Instagram and from Hangouts. Other than that, nothing. Was hoping latest update would fix this problem 
com.achep.acdisplay#153393:	  Music widget not working please fix it 
com.achep.acdisplay#153400:	   Only problem is that it doesn't activate when lifting the phone off the table while the phone is facing upwards. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153402:	  active display doesn't work...pls fix it 
com.achep.acdisplay#153406:	   Looks great but makes my alarms not work on my lg g2. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153410:	   Sucking a plenty of juice after latest update. Replaced with a different lockscreen. Eagerly awaiting for the fix... Luv the app. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153411:	   I love this lock screen. Really its the best one I've used. The only problem is that it snoozes my alarms when they go off. I realize I can use the inactive hours for the lock screen but the alarms should still function without it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153412:	   When unlocking the device, the white circle spread to the whole screen, but now it just stops getting larger at like half an inch on diameter. If this is fixed it deserves a 5 star. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153415:	   Very good concept and used to work great on galaxy S5 KitKat. After lollipop update the animations are a bit glitchy. The app causes a moderate battery drainage, not too bad. And the new wave to wake feature doesn't work at all on my S5!! Please fix that. A pin or password protection is very much required. The lockscreen has few bugs, sometimes it just locks while using the phone. Other than that, it's a very good app and a very smart developer. I like that the team keeps updating the app. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153421:	   Like it but will be better with some security please answer and fix. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153422:	   Used to love this, but now crashes often and makes my phone unresponsive. Will come back if fixed. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153424:	  Keeps crashing when I open the app 
com.achep.acdisplay#153434:	   Thanks. All fixed now and awesome. Anyways pls. Implement a custom wallpaper on the lockscreen. Thank you. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153436:	  Good but lots of bugs. Constant crash with soundcloud and endless notification with textra 
com.achep.acdisplay#153443:	   Just one question, does the new wave to wake feature work the same way as the note 4 wake feature, it's not working on my oneplus one, not sure of I'm doing something wrong... 
com.achep.acdisplay#153446:	  I like this apps but the problem is some times it make hanging problem when i can't unlock my phone without restart... Its bad experience... If u solved this problem i must give you five star..because the apps is really good. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153447:	   Sometime in the last few days this has stopped working. I get the vibrate on double press but nothing happens. Reinstalled and issue persists. Edit: Updated Sense Toolbox and it's fixed :) 
com.achep.acdisplay#153450:	   very awesome app, except it crashes twice a day, glitches with active mode once in a while and always shows me "swipe down to view bar". 
com.achep.acdisplay#153455:	   Awesome material design and works great. Could not help but donate. . Edit: I have an issue, if I had the notification bar down and the lockscreen also has the notification bar. Please fix! 
com.achep.acdisplay#153461:	   I'm having problems with widgets, when I want to select a new widget (even the first one) it closes and let me to the main menu 
com.achep.acdisplay#153481:	   The wave features seems not working 
com.achep.acdisplay#153482:	   At its core, this is a great lock screen replacement. It could be a bit more robust, but the new features seem to be addressing this. There are bugs and they need reporting so it's highly recommended you donate or actively report errors. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153483:	   Recently, ive received notifications from all apps, however the snapchat notifications werent working. Ive checked the blacklist and snapchat notifications arent hidden or on silent.... could you fix it so the snapchat notifications work please? Thanks 
com.achep.acdisplay#153489:	   Galaxy S4 Lollipop, and the Active mode will not work no matter what app or phone settings I apply. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153491:	   I love it, its simple and easy to use and my friends have no clue on how to open my phone! I have one downside though, whenever you press the home button it exists the lock screen. Could you fix this issue? 
com.achep.acdisplay#153500:	   amazing app, only problem is that when playing music through Samsung's pre-installed app or Gplay music it crashes 
com.achep.acdisplay#153502:	  3.4.3 Will not work with Spotify, crashes when trying to display album cover 
com.achep.acdisplay#153504:	   smooth as silk ...faced a bit sudden app failure troubles but all fine after the update .. ! just give me a pattern lock for icing on the cake .. :) 
com.achep.acdisplay#153506:	   The most used lockscreen of all time for me. And i don't use many as they never live upto my expectations. Simple clean and perfect. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153507:	  Don't know why is not working for me after a factory reset.. Having issue while getting notification access.. Please help 
com.achep.acdisplay#153511:	   Fix the unlock whenever I press the home button 
com.achep.acdisplay#153513:	  Apply widget doesn't work on my LG g3. Keeps saying it stopped. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153514:	   Installed to check it out and wouldn't work properly so tried to delete but says it needs admin rights 
com.achep.acdisplay#153516:	   Everything is perfect with this locker except from one thing. I can't add my music widget. Basically, it doesn't ever appear my music widget as a choice to select it. Please fix it :( 
com.achep.acdisplay#153525:	   Waited 3 days for a fix. Still nothing, no clock just a blank lock screen. So I'm uninstalling. Thanks for ruining an awesome app 
com.achep.acdisplay#153534:	   It's perfect designed but unfortunately don't work on lolipop lock screen, if you enable it after unlock the app you need unlock the default android lock screen. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153535:	   I really like this App but after its last couple of updates now it's super buggy and crashes all the time 
com.achep.acdisplay#153538:	   This was a four star but the latest update to my phone makes the app not work at all for me... 
com.achep.acdisplay#153541:	  Crashes when plugging in headphones on z3 5.0.2 
com.achep.acdisplay#153543:	   I love this app, but I have 2 issues, one is that I get a blue screen error all the time. 2. Ever since the last update my battery has been draining like crazy! If you can fix those 2 stuff I would up my review to 5 stars! 
com.achep.acdisplay#153553:	   It stopped working with my Galaxy s4 5.0.1 update please help I love this lock screen 
com.achep.acdisplay#153563:	  Pressing the home button on the lockscreen unlocks the phone. Is this a design or a bug? Can we please have an option to disable it? 
com.achep.acdisplay#153565:	   You fixed the black title bar, awesome 
com.achep.acdisplay#153567:	   thank u! yesterday's biggest update problem for me is that the lockscreen had a black title bar.today's update repairs that! thank u! 
com.achep.acdisplay#153572:	   Love this lock screen, notifications are great and handled well, when they work. Ever since I upgraded to Lollipop, the app will crash from time to time and needs a system reboot to fix. Galaxy Note 4 on ATT. Hoping this update fixes that. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153593:	  Great app, I hope u can add an option to see if WiFi is turned on in the lock screen, also with the recent widget update I am unable to add a widget the app crashes when I do that. Ty 
com.achep.acdisplay#153594:	  Best lock screen. Though when using music controls it will crash sometimes.....also at other random times. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153596:	   I only one problem is that when you click quick reply the android stock lock screen has to be unlocked first. On android 5.0.2. Other then that this app works perfect. I like it a lot. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153602:	   I go to settings, go to interface to change the widget and everysingle time I press the add widget button it always says: Unfourtounately the settings have stopped. PLEASE FIX IT 
com.achep.acdisplay#153608:	   Widgets are not working. 3.4.1 
com.achep.acdisplay#153609:	  It crashes on 3.4 if I try to add a widget 
com.achep.acdisplay#153619:	  Really like the app but have an issue where the notification stays on in my panel despite being dismissed from the lockscreen. Would be perfect if it was fixed. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153621:	   Worked great before, but my alarms don't work, phone unlocks itself when I get a notification. It's a shame because this is a must have app for me. Hopefully bugs gets worked out for Lollipop, but I won't be using it for now. Lg g3 
com.achep.acdisplay#153623:	   It was great until recent updates. Now it crashes. Does not respond. It will also lag when I turn on my screen. I'll see the normal stock lockscreen, unlock the phone, then AC display will finally catch up and lock my screen again. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153625:	   Not working on my galaxy S3 
com.achep.acdisplay#153626:	   I did install and activated everything but the lockscreen does not appear. Please fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#153627:	   I loved this app for its unique way to access notifications,And thanks for the seek bar in latest update,But I'm not giving five star because...there are some bugs to be solved. Like it keeps on flickering whenever any other notifications like call cost or data left messages from the service providers. And it would b helpful if u also provide some kind f PIN or pattern lock 
com.achep.acdisplay#153628:	   Why on earth do you not have a pin or password or pattern? Come on fix this and I will give you give stars 
com.achep.acdisplay#153632:	   Latest update isn't working on android4.3 
com.achep.acdisplay#153633:	   Keeps throwing error on lock screen until I remove the battery. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153644:	   show essential needs, but somehow made my native alarm app stop working when activated. its ok though because there is an inactive period setting.. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153646:	   I really liked the minimalistic design.. But had to uninstall it as it gets opened on pressing home key... Please add this feature of blocking home button... I want to use this app as a lock screen but is of no use to me right now... Sorry... But appreciate your efforts developers :-) 
com.achep.acdisplay#153653:	   Was great before I've updated to 5.0.2. Now it doesn't work. Please fix asap. Great app 
com.achep.acdisplay#153657:	   why after update I always see notif by acdisplay and description below"just dimiss this notofication" it always show event after I clear , fix please 
com.achep.acdisplay#153659:	   The best app you can use as your lockscreen but some problems are there for the notification and that's all thanks guys. :-) 
com.achep.acdisplay#153660:	   Notifications can be easily viewed and dismissed from the lock screen. I am not sure if this app is the reason I am not getting my LED notifications. I can live with it though because the screen comes on when there is a new notification. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153661:	   Excellent app! Works great and has almost constant updates, developer is great about fixing bugs! 
com.achep.acdisplay#153666:	   Too many app updates. Literally one per day. Very irritating. Update once on 15 days or something. Fix the bugs in one go, not incrementally. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153671:	   I love this app! However, I just updated to lollipop and now the lock screen doesn't work at all. That basically defeats the entire purpose of the app. :( Looks like the lock screen option was removed entirely in the last update. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153674:	   Not working on my LG G2 with Lollipop.... 
com.achep.acdisplay#153676:	   This used to be a great app until my last update. Now it crashes on my Galaxy S4. Doesn't give me the updates and notifications as it used to. So will be uninstalling as it doesn't work anymore 
com.achep.acdisplay#153678:	   Not working 
com.achep.acdisplay#153679:	   After update I can't get the widget work it shows error. It kinda sucked. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153683:	   1 problem...show on ac display service ...my uper corner please fix it 
com.achep.acdisplay#153685:	   I like what this lock screen does. Being able to see notifications but just pressing the icon. But my alarm doesn't go off when this is on so I can't use it. Also they should add a passcode unlock because it can be annoying having to go through two lock screens 
com.achep.acdisplay#153687:	   But keeps crashing on my lg g3 since the lollipop update 
com.achep.acdisplay#153689:	  Doesn't work on my 4.2.2 android 
com.achep.acdisplay#153695:	   I have a lg g3 running lollipopand its a awesome substitute lock screen but the only issues i have is the music widget on the lockscreen keep freezing and the app sometimes crashes 
com.achep.acdisplay#153699:	   It is a good app for notification with good interface.. Works smoothly for 4.4 nd above but hav a lot of bugs for jelly bean..Works in compatible mode.. Hope u fix it.. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153706:	   Could be a little more battery optimized. Also the widget stopped working. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153707:	   The lock screen feature hangs and is unresponsive at times. I have to reboot to fix it. That feature is beta and is my favorite feature by far. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153710:	   Crashes at unlock with active chromecast. Was hoping the latest bunch of bug fixes would take care of that as well, but unfortunately not. Other than that, great. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153715:	  Uninstall it.. crash on my htc one m8 
com.achep.acdisplay#153718:	   It's beautiful and I love how it respond my notifications smoothly. Unfortunately it's not good enough as the lockscreen can be exited with only a click of home button. (Galaxy Note 4) I won't reduce my stars because it's close to perfection but I hope the developer can fix it 
com.achep.acdisplay#153723:	   I'm not getting any notifications displayed after the v3.3.1 update. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153738:	   I really like ac display and I've used it for about a year now but recently when ever I unlock it sometimes it freezes on the unlock animation and I would have to turn off my phone in order for it to disappear. If this is fixed then I'll give 5 stars. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153742:	  Music lock screen not working 
com.achep.acdisplay#153743:	   This app was awesome on KitKat, but little less awesome on Lollipop. Still the active mode is killer. However the latest update seems to have broken the 'wake up on notification' setting. ACDisplay keeps waking up (outside pocket) when a notification comes in, even if the option is unchecked and/or the app is put into silent mode. A fix would be nice. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153746:	   Most BS app I ever had. One time it asks for all permission and in a fraction of second it stops working. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153748:	  App is fixed thanks to developer for fast fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#153750:	   not useful on note 4. now cant uninstall this app. what to do? 
com.achep.acdisplay#153751:	   No other lock screen app has this problem. I emailed the developer several days ago and I haven't gotten any reply. Galaxy Grand Prime. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153753:	   It's great. I love the way it looks but if it's a lockscreen, why does the home button bypass it? Once it's fixed it will be 5 stars 
com.achep.acdisplay#153763:	   It was working fine with Kitkat but is now not working with Lolipop 5.1 :-( 
com.achep.acdisplay#153764:	   The app is great but won't work on Lolipop. Updated my Note 4 and was upset to see my lock screen gone. Keep up the good work! Waiting for an update! 
com.achep.acdisplay#153767:	   It's Amazing how it looks like :) but only one thing, I'd like that you prevent making the home, back and the recent app' buttons unlock the lock, it'll be nice to fix it ^^ 
com.achep.acdisplay#153770:	   stopped working. Notifications no longer show on lock screen. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153780:	   Very buggy on the HTC m8. Notifications don't come through most of the time, app crashes frequently. Long delay when opening notifications. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153781:	   Brilliant lock screen but the 'swipe down to exit full screen' option keeps appearing 5 or 6 times a day. Please fix :) other than that I love it 
com.achep.acdisplay#153783:	   After the new update, its crashing frequently..please fix this and also add a music widget for Android 4.2.2 and a custom app switch and also a different background for the lock screen...otherwise.. OUTSTANDING! 
com.achep.acdisplay#153784:	   In general I am really enjoying AcDisplay. It is attractively designed and works well for the most part. My biggest complaint thus far is how it functions when using google maps/navigation, normally navigation is allowed to be displayed without going to the lockscreen, but now with AcDisplay, AcDisplay is displayed when I wake up my phone rather than the current navigation, this is a big issue when driving, I need to be able to get right back to the directions without dealing with the lock screen. My second complaint is that the auto wake is hit and miss, since auto-waking my phone isn't the reason I enjoy this app (notification handling), I would like an option to turn off the auto wake. My last complaint is that I often get the tutorial pop-up telling me about exiting full screen, not a big deal but it does get annoying. Overall great work and great app, if I see some or all of these complaints addressed I will definitely be donating. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153785:	   Thanks for solving the problem related to autostart up.. 1+ star for that feature.. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153789:	   Its a great app. I love it. Please fix active notifications. Yes when I take it out of my pocket it works 7 of 10 times. It would only be useful when I pick it up from the table to check for any notification or time. Or when I am in a meeting and with a minimal movement I want to check what is going on. I was a moto x user and I loved it on the moto it needed no effort to use active notifications. I am not able to use this effortlessly. Please fix active notifications. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153791:	   Great app but stopped working for me after updating to Lollipop. App is turned on but won't operate as the lock screen. UPDATE - got it working again. Back up to 5 stars. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153792:	   I love this lock screen but after AT&T released the Android 5.0 update for HTC One M8, AcDisplay no longer appears. Please fix. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153796:	  Used it for a year with no prob. After last update got unstable and crashes all the time. The bad news is that i cant uninstall it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153807:	   An excellent lock screen, which is even better for devices with S-AMOLED displays... Just couldn't figure out why the app asks the Xposed framework, even though it is working well without it... Xposed doesn't support Lollipop as of now, so... Also, 3 Stars because enabling both options in Dynamic Background and playing music crashes the app... Please fix this. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153808:	   Off times, with google play, this app crashes 
com.achep.acdisplay#153811:	   Location unlock doesn't work. Uninstalled!!! 
com.achep.acdisplay#153819:	  Thank you for bug fixes 
com.achep.acdisplay#153826:	   This used to be a great app, and I am sure it will be again, but the latest update is very buggy. Sometimes upon waking the screen ACDisplay fails to start despite being set to work as the lock screen, leaving me on my home screen. Also if I have music playing 9 times out of 10 the music controls fail to display on ACDisplay, instead causing the clock and notification info to disappear, leaving only a blank screen. As it is now I simply cannot recommend it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153850:	   I just updated my galaxy note 3 (AT&T) to lollipop 5.0 and now it won't work and I can't uninstall 
com.achep.acdisplay#153870:	   Mmm it doesn't work anymore on Android 5.0.2 help!! 
com.achep.acdisplay#153874:	   Unfortunately pressing the home button on Samsung devices bypasses the lock screen if this was fixed and next alarm info on lockscreen added this would be perfect. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153879:	   When I was running HTC M7 with KitKat. Ever since upgrading to Lollipop it gets stuck in a weird flashing loop on some notifications. Real shame as its a great feature to be able to glance at notifications in a similar manner to that found on the Moro X. Hopefully it gets fixed in an update, but have disabled for now. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153883:	   Works great however, how many times do I have to okay the notification that swiping down pulls it our of full screen mode. Annoying as hell. Fix it. And could us some help with the GUI. More user friendly? I'll add stars when it's all addressed. Otherwise great alternative to active screen. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153893:	   Aside from the "Full screen" problem, it's skipable nature and battery problems (XPERIA M2) It's an absolute perfection 
com.achep.acdisplay#153897:	   I love this app but its crashing after last update... 
com.achep.acdisplay#153911:	   Modified my review to 5 stars because the error I had was fixed! 
com.achep.acdisplay#153912:	   Last update killed it...always crashed and hangs...too bad it was awesome. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153916:	   One issue. Lockscreen does not display music 
com.achep.acdisplay#153918:	  Shitty app doesnt uninstall in my note 3 and note 2 . Fix it . 
com.achep.acdisplay#153929:	   I've been using it for a couples months and now it's like I cannot use my phone without it. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153933:	   I love this app! But every timture I get a notification, even when I turn wake screen on notification off, the every time I get a notification, the screen turns on every time the notification light flashes. Please fix and will be five stars! 
com.achep.acdisplay#153940:	  Does not work in my kitkat 
com.achep.acdisplay#153941:	   Even the setting is not full screen, sometimes I get notification/instructions for full-screen mode from Xperia OS (KITKAT). It was disturbed. Make the interface glitches. And please give additional settings for wake up screen time response in active mode. I need quick response from the screen before decide to press my lock screen button, because sometimes active mode doesn't work. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153943:	  Error 944? 
com.achep.acdisplay#153947:	   I had to factory reset my phone, now I can't download it error (944) 
com.achep.acdisplay#153951:	  Please fix issue 
com.achep.acdisplay#153953:	   There is now a big where I cannot unlock my phone please fix this app. It happens once in a while 
com.achep.acdisplay#153954:	   Active mode still not working for xperia z1. Why not create a "double tap to sleep" function too 
com.achep.acdisplay#153955:	   Everything about it is perfect except the notification in my pull bar never going away that says "AcDisplay Services Active Mode, Lockscreen". Thanks but I already know it's running. I am the one who kinda turned it on. Fix that and it'll be way better.. Also it needs its on PIN settings 
com.achep.acdisplay#153960:	   ... everything was fine in Kit Kat. In Lollipop (LG G3) the built-in alarm/timer fails to sound, only leaves a notification and directly snoozed. While 3rd party alarm/timer couldn't bypass AcDisplay but merely sounding in the background. Meaning I have to switch on the display, swipe to unlock before I can dismiss them. And also in Lollipop it displays multiple notifications from different Whatsapp conversations plus an additional main one. In Kit Kat it used to show only a main notification. Please fix. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153961:	   Pocket sensor not working with zenfone5.. ;( 
com.achep.acdisplay#153966:	   Simple, elegant and best in its category. A must have notification app. But sometimes it fails to lock screen. That's very rare bug though 
com.achep.acdisplay#153977:	   It crashes 
com.achep.acdisplay#153988:	   The active mode won't work so please fix that one mistake because other than that the app is excellent 
com.achep.acdisplay#153990:	   I like the app's features, but Android Lollipop has made the application less useful. There are also some bugs with turning on the notification and default screens. I blocked notifications from the app to stop the always on active mode notification, but that blocks the test notifications too. 
com.achep.acdisplay#153993:	   But my phone tends to run hot, then the touch screen doesn't work. Also short battery life. Can you fix it! 
com.achep.acdisplay#153997:	   Dynamic background not work ..lollipop...moto g...custom rom ...xposed modual.... 
com.achep.acdisplay#154001:	   I think this app is amazing, beyond expectations. The only issue I have, honestly is the security of the application. There is no screen lock, so anybody can access my information. Adding this feature would seal the deal for me. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154003:	   I've always got problem when putting my phone in my pocket. The phone accidentally turn on cuz by d double tap to wake feature. Now it's not working no matter how often it's tapped in d pocket. And last,it's sooooo simple! Love it 
com.achep.acdisplay#154007:	   Won't work with my note 4 
com.achep.acdisplay#154011:	  Best Lock Screen i'm Ever seen :* But i have bug kill me :( Every time i restart phone..I must active it "AGIAN" -_- 
com.achep.acdisplay#154022:	   I seem to have a problem with the app. Ever since the update music player screen doesnt show up when playing a music. Even if I deactivate/active admin and check/uncheck accessibility with the app it still wouldnt show up. Please I need help 
com.achep.acdisplay#154037:	   HTC One (m7) after updating to lollipop I am seeing double notifications for textra and other minor bugs 
com.achep.acdisplay#154052:	   It drives me batty that the icons of the notifications from the same application does not consolidate, or override. For example: If I receive a notification from my email client, I get an icon with a number 1 to indicate one unread message. If at some point I receive a second email, I then get a second icon on the lock screen, with the number 2 in it - the original is still there. Also, after 3 rows of icons (typically due to the problem mentioned above), I'm not able to dismiss any of them, and must reboot 
com.achep.acdisplay#154058:	  It always flicrs on my moto g 2 plz fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#154061:	  Never comes on my lock screen... No use at all.... Disgraced 
com.achep.acdisplay#154065:	   This is the best lockscreen notifications app I have used so far. A clean interface with a poetic touch. I would have given it 5 stars if not for a small flaw - if there are multiple rows of notifications, I cannot swipe away a notification on the row above without touching one below. This forces me to always dismiss the notification on the lower row first. Hope this flaw will be fixed soon! 
com.achep.acdisplay#154071:	   I love love love my new lock screen. The only problem I have is that you can bypass the AcDisplay lock screen by pressing the home button. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154073:	  Its very nice app but use lots of battery and ram...so plz...try to solve this problem...otherwise its very usefull app. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154074:	   NIce app. However, it  with flash blink, Hopefully you can fix it! 
com.achep.acdisplay#154078:	   How do you uninstall it tried to be it doesn't let me please help this app doesn't work for my phone 
com.achep.acdisplay#154082:	   After the update, I am now getting double the notifications meaning after receiving a text (Textra), I'm getting two icons with the same message. The same is with WhatsApp. However, Snapchat, Instagram and email apps seem to work fine. I'd really appreciate if you could fix this soon as I really like using this app. Thanks! 
com.achep.acdisplay#154083:	   The app used to work flawlessly on kitkat but after upgrading to lollipop, I've started facing issues like the screen flickering when a notification arrives, and the phone hangs every now and then. Also the app lacks a native screen lock mechanism and the active mode is not sensitive enough. Requires a huge improvement to work without bugs on lollipop. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154091:	   After upgrading to Android Lollipop version, AC display not working. Keeps asking for Required Permissions-Device Admin. I keep activating it but it refuses to work. Please fix this. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154109:	   Plzz fix it as it cause huge 
com.achep.acdisplay#154110:	   I used to love ac display, however this latest update has killed it for me, I can no longer see notifications and the timer bar has gone, both the things I love most about this app, if someone could let me know how to get this back I would be greatful as it really is an incredible lock screen, however with no notifications showing up (on note 4, 4.4.4) it's pretty useless and I'm gonna go back to L Lockscreen until this gets fixed 
com.achep.acdisplay#154115:	  After new update, it have problem on my HTC one m7 seems that wake up notification does not function and no notification appear in the lock screen 
com.achep.acdisplay#154117:	   When I play music the lock screen music control doesn't come up. I use Spotify as my primary music player and I have an lg g3. Also one other person with an lg g3 had a similar problem when it comes to text notifications. I get duplicate notifications for a text. I reset my device to try to clear this but it didn't work. Please resolve this or if there's solutions to these problems. Thanks. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154123:	   I like the app however the shake to wake up feature is really bad. The feature needs to be a lot more sensitive to shakes. If there is a feature it better work. If that gets fixed I will revert back to 5 stars 
com.achep.acdisplay#154130:	   Only works when app is set to lock screen. Update: Fixed! 5 stars 
com.achep.acdisplay#154136:	  IT'S CRASHING NOW FREQUENTLY. NOTIFICATIONS ARE NOT WORKING EITHER. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154139:	   Only problem I get is sometimes the normal Z3 is the lock screen instead of this application and it sometimes flashes grey before going to my custom screen saver. All in all though a very nice application! 
com.achep.acdisplay#154141:	   Used to work flawlessly on OnePlus One. But after the latest OPO update, it tend to freeze my lockscreen and i have to reboot. I don't have this problem if ACDisplay is inactive. Really appreciate if could fix this as i love the app 
com.achep.acdisplay#154142:	  Clean and simple! Great work! Only issue is every so often the full screen mode notification pops up even when I don't have full screen mode highlighted ac display settings 
com.achep.acdisplay#154143:	   Everything is working great, just hate the "exit fullscreen message" or whatever coming up everytime the screen locks. With or without the box being checked for full screen on or off, it still shows, which sucks. Please fix this. It at least happens on LG G2. 4 stars until fixed. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154145:	   on my S5 - acDisplay is on top of my fingerprint lock screen. With Active mode, I can check quickly if there are new notifications, touch the notification for a summary, swipe it away (or mark Done! in In box) or open it. To open and get details I need to go through my Fingerprint lock, etc., so snoopers can't get more than a quick summary if anything. Meanwhile my choice to act on a notification, see the time, data and battery, all while maintaining a nice black background saves battery. Very well thou 
com.achep.acdisplay#154155:	   This is by far the best app. Now I don't have to have a Moto x to get this feature. For anyone wondering about stability it is amazing the app never crashes. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154159:	   How do I uninstall this app ? whenever I try to deactivate it, it doesn't work.. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154166:	   When I set it as a lock screen, if I unlock it the system lock screen appears. This is quite annoying. Any fix? Running 5.0 on N4. UPDATE: fixed. Brilliant as always 
com.achep.acdisplay#154168:	   Great app until the newest update. Constantly crashing and when I first turn on my screen, sometimes it displays notifications, sometimes not. Please fix! 
com.achep.acdisplay#154170:	   Just what I was looking for. Best, customizable lock screen!! The only issue I'm having is that it doesn't always display my Google Play Music playing. Please fix! 
com.achep.acdisplay#154178:	   This update crashes alot need to fix 
com.achep.acdisplay#154179:	   Developer promptly responded to complaints about issues with latest update and put out a fix even on the weekend. Props 
com.achep.acdisplay#154180:	   The pocket sensor thing doesn't work on the Asus zenphone 5 please do something 
com.achep.acdisplay#154187:	  Can't remove/uninstall. Says it needs to be deactivated its administrative but nothing happens and uninstall doesnt highlight!!!!! 
com.achep.acdisplay#154201:	  Doesn't work for HTC one 
com.achep.acdisplay#154210:	   Doesn't rotate on the sony Xperia z2 tablet(( 
com.achep.acdisplay#154221:	   Claims to turn screen on when pulled out of a pocket. Simply doesn't work. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154228:	   Great app, but i can't use it on my moto g 2nd gen after updating to lollipop. I can't set the lock screen settings as none so i have to select swipe. Any idea how i can make it work? 
com.achep.acdisplay#154243:	   Won t let me access it the on/off button is in off position but won't allow me to turn it on. Please fix! It won't let me disable it or uninstall it either! Very unhappy customer! 
com.achep.acdisplay#154245:	   Everything works ok except one little thing. When I press home button on lockscreen it automatically opens recent apps. I'm not holding it longer, it's just a normal press, for waking display. My home button is working fine, it's not broken, it happens only when I'm using this app. Also, it unlocks phone if I press home button twice. It would be nice to have an option to disable this. I know it's still beta, but this should be fixed. Thanks! 
com.achep.acdisplay#154248:	   Lockscreen doesn't work, active display doesn't work.. I allowed all the permissions, but still nothing. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154252:	   The lockscreen prevents my alarm from going off. I love the app otherwise. Is there a fix for this? 
com.achep.acdisplay#154257:	   It some how blocks the Quick Circle case from working. Is there a way to fix that? This has been a great fix for the 5.0.1 update taking away widgets. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154263:	   Looks like bugs all fixed now, thanks Dev 
com.achep.acdisplay#154276:	   It is a great app, and good come back on fixes. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154281:	   On my xperia z ultra device when i am running any app and i lock and unlock the device, the blue bar of exiting full screen keep pops up... And even when i am not running any app on full screen like the app itself, it keeps showing up. And i always have to hit the ok buttong before unlock the device. Please fix this and I'll give you 5 stars thanks 
com.achep.acdisplay#154284:	   Didn't have any problem with the app. Working smooth on my phone. I would prefer though that it doesn't stay on my notification list or at least can be removed from there. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154287:	   Only problem is the alarm doesnt work, well it comes on for half a second, before the lockscreen lights up the display and turns off the alarm. Dissapointing feature that nearly made me sleep in. Luckily i was half awake. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154295:	   Lovely lock screen but randomly flicks a crash report which you can't stop until you've unlocked. HTC one m8 with lollipop 
com.achep.acdisplay#154312:	   issues on . unlock doesn't work. i need to unlock twice, using acdisplay and system unlock. can you fix this sir? it would be great. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154315:	   I love this application but I can't use it on a day to day basis due to some issues. When I use the hot word detection, said app activates but then screen goes immediately back to acDisplay. Also getting double notification for emails (individual emails and then grouped together) and texts. This doesn't happen with native android lock screen. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154317:	   Everything is good and working properly except the lock button to end call, the app overrides the function and instead of ending the call it locks the phone with the call still going. I would like to see that fixed. Using LG G2 Mini, Android 4.4. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154319:	   The problem was uninstalling, but a simple fix. Go under settings, then go to security, device administrator, then uncheckmark a.c. active display. Congrats, you can now uninstall this app. Other than the fact that it doesn't work on s3 4.4.2, it was a great concept 
com.achep.acdisplay#154320:	   Please please please fix this problem. Only your lockscreen app does this on my note 4 . When the phone is locked I press the home button to unlock the screen, so your lockscreen appears which is good. BUT...... when I press the home button again it takes me to the original Samsung lockscreen! Why??? This is The only lockscreen that does this and I really want to use this lockscreen app, it's the best but you have to fix this problem PLEASE! 
com.achep.acdisplay#154325:	   it's great app but when I click on the home it is unlocked... can u fix it to make the home deactivated?? 
com.achep.acdisplay#154334:	   Have a an issue with my lock screen. Any time my screen wakes my phone thinks I'm viewing a picture full screen and tells me "Swipe down from top of screen to exit full screen". Apart from that works great. (Sony Xperia Z2, latest Android version) 
com.achep.acdisplay#154341:	   It's a great lock screen, only thing I found to make me not use it was the task in the notifications. That bothers me. Other than that it's smooth, I won't be using it though. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154342:	   I like everything about it, except that you can bypass the lock screen with the home button. Please fix!:) 
com.achep.acdisplay#154344:	   A few issues persist with lollipop. The most annoying one being that WhatsApp notifications leave multiple icons for separate conversations. Please look into that apart from those, hats off! Keep up the good work :) 
com.achep.acdisplay#154349:	   Amazing, but i have a little problem. Is it just one notification in one app? What if more than one person chat you in one app. I give you 5 star after you answer or update. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154352:	  The app is great but I don't know y when I sometimes open it my screen just turns off its self I believe it's the app because before that I didn't have any issues over all its sick as hell keep it up 
com.achep.acdisplay#154357:	  There is a problem to uninstall this app 
com.achep.acdisplay#154359:	   I am a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 owner that recently updated to 5.0 lollipop. The alarm clock fails to work when the screen is locked. Please fix this! 
com.achep.acdisplay#154363:	   The UI of this app is awesome. A really clean look amd feel. Esepecially on my Galaxy S4, this app really saves battery life because I have an AMOLED panel. Really awesome app. The only problem I have which made me uninstall this app is that the lock screen only appeared when I have a notification. When I don't have any notification and I turn off the screen then turn on, the lock screen doesn't come out. I liked the clean look and feel but because of my problem there, I uninstalled this app. Fix it please. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154364:	   No security to lock the screen, no pin, pattern, or anything. If security is in the pipeline, it would be great to have trusted wifi or Bluetooth or both. Also, it looks nice, but on tablets it's a bit small in the font category and doesn't rotate. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154369:	   GREAT app, but still tons of problems. EVERY TIME YOU OPEN THE APP, YOU ARE ON THE HOME SCREEN, NOT ON THE APP THAT WAS LAST OPEN. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154370:	   For kitkat, this was the best lock screen app out there in my opinion. Now, after getting the lollipop update I get multiple what's app notifications for the same message. Also, and this one is the biggest for me, my google music options (pause/play and forward/backwards) Do not show up on the lock screen when music is going. Is there any way to put an update out to fix these issues developers? Thank you 
com.achep.acdisplay#154372:	   This app is awesome, the only problem I have is the blue box that pop ups every now and then and tell me that I can swipe from above to get full screen,, OK I got it the first time, no need to show it again nd again.. it gets annoying.. otherwise it's a beautiful app thank you drvelopers 
com.achep.acdisplay#154373:	   I really liked it. Perfect application for managing notifications. Active mode is not working well with cyanogen 11 on oneplus one. Sometimes it is impossible to unlock screen because screen never comes up :) 
com.achep.acdisplay#154378:	   Few errors I found - 1. On lock screen pressing the home button took away the lock screen. Please disable that too like multitasking button. 2. The Facebook Lite notification icon looks a bit narrow and not a square. Please fix these. I really like the unlock animation. After that double tap lock screen off feature, this looks more great. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154382:	   active mode does not work perfectly everytime, but the lock screen effect is very impressive 
com.achep.acdisplay#154391:	   Love this app, love that it pops up notifications even when locked. Unfortunately on my cm12 lollipop build, there are some issues. When acdisplay tries to lock the screen, the lock sound seems to play 3 or 4 times in quick succession. Also it doesn't actually seem to lock the screen, as the next time I got to turn the screen on, it goes right to the home screen without the lock screen popping up. 
com.achep.acdisplay#154403:	  I love this app and it's my favorite lock screen out there but after updating to Lollipop, when I unlock it, it takes me to the default lock screen. I'm having to unlock twice to get into my phone. When they fix it you'll get 5 stars back for sure! 
com.achep.acdisplay#154405:	   Ever since the 5.0 lollipop update the lockscreen is generally incapable of displaying music artwork. That's the only major problem I know of right now, besides that, Kik messenger appears in the lock screen notification tray twice, even when you've received one message. Besides that the design is majestic and beautiful and despite the slight problems I like it a lot.
