com.ichi2.anki#170004:	  Someday After updating the Anki crashed 
com.ichi2.anki#170011:	  The app was one of my favourites but somehow it does not work anymore (It only shows the 'settings' tab and whenever I click 'back' it closes and I get a notification that Ankidroid doesn't work at the moment.) which puts me in alot of trouble with my upcoming exams next week for which I now have to write everything down somewhere else again. It would be incredibly helpful if this was fixed.Before this I would have given a five star rating. 
com.ichi2.anki#170023:	  Crashes everytime I try to change a card's type 
com.ichi2.anki#170036:	   Its says encountered problem. I have force stop, clear data and more. Nothing could helps 
com.ichi2.anki#170044:	  Love the concept, however the desktop platform is not convenient. I have been attempting to export decks from the desktop to the app for the past 3 hours. I keep receiving the same error "not valid .apkg file". If you need a 30+ page manual to explain how to use a software you are doing something wrong. 
com.ichi2.anki#170045:	  Reset progress option in card crashes the app. Kindly debug. Thanks 
com.ichi2.anki#170050:	  The app was perfect... Until the update. Now you can't delete note types or check empty cards without getting an error message (did they even do BETA testing?) seems like instead of adding features, they're just taking some away... 
com.ichi2.anki#170053:	  It's a wonderful app, I try to use it every day. However, it seems it's not displaying line height properly. In my card CSS I have set a line height, but it's not working. 
com.ichi2.anki#170056:	  I'm starting to get used to this. But then one day I accidentally deleted one card then I can't find a way to bring it back! No deleted folder on app? If you could respond please I have serious short term memory so I tend to forget things very easily. I can't remember which card I deleted! 
com.ichi2.anki#170062:	  Add the support for android nougat permissions, the app crashes every time I try to add image 
com.ichi2.anki#170074:	  Awesome but, it can't read/open the AnkiDroid files generated by the JED app. It would be super if you fix that 
com.ichi2.anki#170076:	  Hi, I was wondering can I not revise my staff 2 or more times? When I revise it once, all of my notes will disappear. Can someone help me to solve this problem. Thanks. 
com.ichi2.anki#170096:	  AnkiDroid is really helpful when i don't have much time with my PC. This is the most important app in my Android, and the bugs on the latest version is so much fixed. Thanks AnkiDroid team. 
com.ichi2.anki#170116:	  Have been using this app for years and suddenly am unable to delete a profile I don't want anymore. I got the following error message: An error occurred. It may have been caused by a harmless bug, or your deck may have a problem. To confirm it's not a problem with your deck, please run Tools > Check Database. If that doesn't fix the problem, please copy the following into a bug report: Traceback (most recent call last): File "aqtmain.py", line 210, in onRemProfile File "aqtprofiles.py", line 151, in remove File "thirdpartysend2trashplat_win.py", line 56, in send2trash WindowsError: [Error 5] Access is denied: u'C:UsersSonikaDocumentsAnkiSonika' Please advise! 
com.ichi2.anki#170118:	  The best flash card software after testing many others especially on windows, and its free. thx to developers ***********only one thing: the desktop version plays mp4 video formats but mobile version dosnt. Deer developer pls help this problem occourd after flashing to android 6 and reinstalling ankidroid v. 2.7 
com.ichi2.anki#170128:	  Very easy and simple to use. Suggestion: The whiteboard , handdrawn notes should be saved. Currently it is not saved when the card is shown again. 
com.ichi2.anki#170130:	  But the NULL input filter is stuck if once triggered. Please correct this. Update 22.1.2017 Thanks for fixing :) 
com.ichi2.anki#170132:	  Usability is insane. I spend huge amount of time just to import my file and still can't find how to just reverse cards 
com.ichi2.anki#170153:	   Anki is a great app for memorising. The problem I have encountered is that, if I haven't been using anki for days and then started reviewing the cards, the time periods on good and easy button behave as if I have been reviewing them regularly. It shows big times like 29 days, 1.5 month etc, when clearly, I haven't been reviewing them so I need to review them more often than what the app is suggesting. What is the solution? 
com.ichi2.anki#170162:	   This is the BEST APP for remembering anything no doubt but, I'm having really big problems with this app. I was going on it for my daily learning routine but I found that all the letters were on top of each other that I couldn't read it at all, this happened on every card I flipped, I have been using this app for a while now but this just happened recently, please fix. I have a Lenovo TB3-850F 
com.ichi2.anki#170178:	  I cant download from the shared decks unless im on a computer... i don't have a computer :( i had this app a year ago and didn't have this problem. 
com.ichi2.anki#170184:	   Is there a way to review cards based on the sorting options in the card browser? Like created time? The desktop client couldn't fix it despite not including the scheduling options. The cards show based on time added are all over the place. 
com.ichi2.anki#170192:	   1.Timing error for Turkey 2.I changed the fonts of some sections in card, it shows the change in anki app on computer but it doesn't show it in ankidroid. 3. Backup doesn't work 
com.ichi2.anki#170194:	   All my cards are gone now, I haven't used that for 4 months and when I returned I saw all my cards are gone 
com.ichi2.anki#170207:	   When I try and open the app it tells me I need to turn off the screen overlay (which is already turned off and my phone won't let me turn it on anyway) and after that fails it says AnkiDroid directory is inaccessible. It's probably a problem with my phone rather than the app but help would be appreciated 
com.ichi2.anki#170210:	  I would have failed out of school without this app. 
com.ichi2.anki#170217:	   Can't access all of my deck- it says that I have no cards due, even though there are so many in my deck. If I can't resolve this, I'm going to have to delete the app. :( 
com.ichi2.anki#170232:	   No contest, the best study app available. Simple, syncs to my dictionaries and has never given me any issues whatsoever. 
com.ichi2.anki#170234:	   The app marks "Good" answers as wrong and reviews them immediately. If there's any fix to this then please let me know, but it's making reviewing flashcards needlessly difficult. 
com.ichi2.anki#170252:	   I don't mind writing the cards myself, it helps me learn them. And there's nothing fancy in there for no useful reason. 
com.ichi2.anki#170253:	   I am using anki now over 5 years and it's the only app I always keep on my phone. Doesn't matter which languages or other stuff, anki never failed to be awesome! Thanks guys for this app! You deserve 10 stars 
com.ichi2.anki#170257:	   1. Newly added collections are added directly into "default" deck. By no means it is retaining it's new named deck. 2. In the card browser menu, I wish there was an option to mark the cards quickly or in the easiest possible way and that selected cards can be shifted to the desired named deck directly instead of manually going into each card and then select edit option.....to change its deck. Please help solve these problems. Thank you. 
com.ichi2.anki#170260:	   Thanks to this app, I no longer have to make my own reviews manually and cover the answer with my hand. I haven't failed a single exam, not that it's common or anything, but thanks to this I have no worries. I have given my account to my fellow friends from class, thanks to the syncing option, and we take turns making our reviews through this. I really wished I had found this app sooner it has really been a life changer and I love apps that do just that, change lives. Thanks a bunch for making this! :D 
com.ichi2.anki#170262:	   On Android Nougat 7.1 it's has become impossible to sync your collection across devices rendering the cloud sync feature useless. This error appears when trying to login. Note: This error might happen when upgrading to Android 7, but a simple reinstallation should fix it so make sure to backup your collection beforehand. I've updated the review score to reflect this. A clean install SHOULDN'T encounter this issue so it's only relevant for previous users. 
com.ichi2.anki#170276:	   I can't download any decks !! I press download but no response at all 
com.ichi2.anki#170277:	   I'm trying to make a japanese map deck filled with kanji to learn how to read all prefectures and cities. I always get an error adding this note toast. I really wanna use this app so please help. Thank you. 
com.ichi2.anki#170289:	   It's crashing when I try to take a photograph for a flash card, has been for weeks, going to uninstall it. Tried to reinstall it already and issue is still happening, keeps sending errors to developer but I've heard nothing about a fix 
com.ichi2.anki#170313:	   If it doesn't ignore files in folders it likes to crash. Horrible app made by the devil. Gave me a headache trying to get it to work. You win! 
com.ichi2.anki#170330:	  This app will not let me add or import any decks when they are in the appropriate folder. Went to the website for support and there is no way of contact, just given a list of random issues that does not help my said problem. 
com.ichi2.anki#170335:	   Have been using Anki throughout my CS degree and it's awesome..! Thank you very much for keeping this android version for free..! My wife who also uses anki in her laptop, can't use the iOS version due to the crazy high price. Thank you very much guys, I have not found a bug and this free version works great..! 
com.ichi2.anki#170342:	   I love it! But get sick of it not notifying me when cards are on due. I will be appreciated if the app is fixed! 
com.ichi2.anki#170359:	   Exactly what I need. My own content. Doesn't get in my way. Syncs to all devices. Is free. Doesn't crash. Just works! 
com.ichi2.anki#170362:	   Ankidroid flashcards made through image occlusion are not getting opened. Solve it immediately 
com.ichi2.anki#170370:	   This app is not only helpful, it's also addictive! I did have an issue: I removed media from deleted decks in Anki desktop, then synced to Ankiweb, then to Ankidroid. For some reason Ankidroid would restore those unlinked media files, so I had to delete all my decks, do an empty cross-sync and start over. Not a big deal being a useful and free app, but I would recommend to anyone with the same issue just to save time if the sync keeps mumping up. Huge thanks to the Dev Team! 
com.ichi2.anki#170377:	  It didn't work 
com.ichi2.anki#170382:	   best app out there for flash cards. Only a few drawbacks, cannot automatically create a reverse deck of another deck and cannot pause a deck. I think those functions are essential especially the last one. For example you are going on holidays during a week, you don't really want to come back to a massive review count when you come back. 
com.ichi2.anki#170400:	  Great app, but syncing/transferring decks sucks. From cell to pc if fine, but pc to cellphone is terrible/almost impossible. Maybe I am not getting something (but that is not my mistake, it's theirs for not making it clear/foolproof). Admittedly, it's it deserves 4 stars. Had I paid for it, it would only get 1 for not performing on par on the syncing front. 
com.ichi2.anki#170404:	   I haven't had any issues but I can see how it can be confusing for some. The UI definitely needs to be cleaner and a built in way to get shared decks would be very beneficial 
com.ichi2.anki#170412:	   Seems to be impossible to set up a cloze function. The manual is for the desktop version, and the option to select what is to be the hidden text isn't available in this Android version. Please try to fix this. Thanks 
com.ichi2.anki#170426:	   I want to go through cards at night with no volume. However, with each card, the volume on my phone increases by 1. Hard to get flowing when I have to keep turning volume down every few cards. But great app! Happy to rate 5 with this fixed or some workaround 
com.ichi2.anki#170441:	   This app it's not working in my cellphone, I don't know what happen but it didn't even start. Please fix it. 
com.ichi2.anki#170444:	   Thank u man, this is the best app ever, (tnx for fixing play botton) 
com.ichi2.anki#170445:	   For some reason certain words get mixed with other flashcards. My flashcard for 'ataque' is always with the word 'el telono celular' and several others have the same problem. I've tried separating the decks but it's no use. Deeply disappointed in this app. 
com.ichi2.anki#170446:	  Best SRS (Spaced Repetition Software) app. Bad reviews probably didn't get that the app doesn't include any ready-made flashcard deck, so the shared decks are made by users (that's why some may contain errors). There are great shared decks though (at least for japanese I've found great ones), and in any case the best way to use this app would be to make your own flashcards. 
com.ichi2.anki#170453:	  The function red marked line of duplicated card is not work correctly ( in particular for old added cards, maybe after cards import ) 2. Sometimes cards are not refreshed in the card browser (after adding card) 
com.ichi2.anki#170456:	  Have I missed something ? I read a lot of good things about this app so I wanted to use it to practice my chinese with flash cards. There is very little content and the only stuff I got has some errors in it / poor quality. I assume I'll have to continue my search for a great chinese flashcards app. 
com.ichi2.anki#170468:	  Terrific app! Thanks to all who work on it. Two small requests: 1. The language I'm learning uses three fairly obscure characters:   . These show up fine on the desktop version, but render as blank spaces or a ? on the app. These misrenders then get synced back onto the database. Is there a chance this could get fixed, or should I go ahead and find alternate characters to represent them? 2. One of the advantages of a mobile app flashcard system is that you can easily create audio flashcards in the field. The current app requires five touches to record audio (+, Add, paperclip, record audio, RECORD). It would be great to be able to do this in fewer steps, though I realize that might not be possible without overcrowding the interface. 
com.ichi2.anki#170487:	   Ever since new update on June 14th, whenever I record audio, playing the play button does nothing. When editing each card and trying to play the audio, it will fail. However, the audio can be heard when studying the card. This makes it very inconvenient for users to know if the recording succeeded 
com.ichi2.anki#170506:	   It can't run on my lg g2 after i upgraded to android 5.0.1. Please check error! 
com.ichi2.anki#170519:	   I simply can't love you enough. Guys I'm having crashes with the latest version 
com.ichi2.anki#170524:	  This app is the most useful helpful thing I have ever found in my entire life, no joke Without this app, I'd be failing my exams because I've ended up making over 1000 school flashcards and I'm relying on anki for those good grades It's just so much easier than making real life flashcards 5/5 
com.ichi2.anki#170532:	   Sync but more importantly the pictures from the advanced editor work again. Very happy. Fantastic app and great dev team! Update: I haven't used anki in quite a while and recently started it back up and couldn't seem to be able to add pictures from Google/search in the advanced editor. Was this feature dropped? I really hope not as that was an extremely useful feature and would love to have it back in :( 
com.ichi2.anki#170540:	   This application will not open at all on my android phone. 
com.ichi2.anki#170593:	   It was a great app, but now you can move the app to SD card, yet all media files will stay at your device! Don't understand why other apps don't have this problem. With some apps you can't move them and still can set them to save all files at SD card. Useless to me until problem will be solved. 
com.ichi2.anki#170608:	   kindly fix! i badly want to use this app. Thanks a lot  
com.ichi2.anki#170613:	   Tried to import .anki files, didn't work, kind of dumb when your apps name is AnkiDroid, no? Only .akpg is allowed. The developer's comments made clear why it did not work, however backwards compatibility might be more helpful than a guide on how to convert the old format to the new one. This particular deck I could not find in any other format, and converting was honestly not something I had thought of. 
com.ichi2.anki#170622:	  Most of the image files don't load on phone even though they are working properly on the desktop version. Please fix. Thank you. 
com.ichi2.anki#170628:	   Tablet won't sync to decks made on the desktop program and phone won't sync because the time isn't in sync down to the second 
com.ichi2.anki#170639:	   The only problem I have is that reminder (about more than 10 waiting cards) doesn't appear until app is launched. Can this be fixed or workaronded? Android 5.0.2 (Xperia ZR). Yes, AnkiDroid Widget should be added to desktop (thanks to support!). 
com.ichi2.anki#170647:	   Not sure if it even still applies to this version, because I deleted some of my more useless media files long time ago, but it used to have some limitation on number of media files (something to do with either Android or some types of storage iirc, which only allows you about 40,000 files (not sure if this was the exact number) in one folder), which could be easily fixed by Ankidroid creating additional media folders when you reach the maximum number of files per media folder. Apart from this, great app. 
com.ichi2.anki#170651:	   , but sometimes audio cards don't work 
com.ichi2.anki#170652:	   Says connection error or file is too large, but it's not... 
com.ichi2.anki#170662:	   Small widget doesn't work in android 6.0 LG G3. I mean it doesn't show untrained words. 
com.ichi2.anki#170666:	   daily notification not working. It will notify me about card due if I open it once a day. Sometimes I forget to check the app and there are so many cards remain due please fix it. 
com.ichi2.anki#170669:	   Can't use it to learn Chinese, Japanese or any other language that doesn't use a traditional alphabet. 
com.ichi2.anki#170671:	  Can't sync files from Android phone to Apple desktop. Overall, the synching interface is very old school and kind of tedious. 
com.ichi2.anki#170676:	   I got a new phone and after a couple of days I wanted ankidroid but when I got it my previous data was nowhere to be found. Please help soon or I might be really upset with you guys. I won't mind if my data isn't saved I'd just like it to recognize my decks from my sd card like before. 
com.ichi2.anki#170687:	  I've been a user of Anki since '07 or so. Ankidroid does what I need, it doesn't annoy me or crash, and is pretty easy to navigate and use. It brings the full power of SRS to mobile devices, so I can study anywhere, all for free. I'm truly thankful for the team that created and updates it voluntarily - you guys rock! (Edit: the version as of Feb 2016 is even better, I'm loving the improved UI!) 
com.ichi2.anki#170694:	   Gestures (taps in certain areas on card) often don't work and I'm forced to tap the buttons to get to next card where it works again. 
com.ichi2.anki#170701:	   Upon opening, get wheel of death and nothing appears. On a menu selection, keeps saying ankidroid directory is inaccessible and then crashes out. 
com.ichi2.anki#170722:	  Sound problems and decks disappear! 
com.ichi2.anki#170741:	   I had high hopes for this app to learn Spanish. But extremely time-consuming and confusing to learn how to use. Terminology used is unclear, not user-friendly. Ex.: 'study' would be more clear, obvious and accurate than 'review'. Review means to see again. It implies the material has been seen before and is a more cursory exposure to the material. I also can't remember where various features are: must search endlessly. Too complicated to learn. Descriptions too technical,nerdy.Optional pop-ups would help. 
com.ichi2.anki#170765:	   I use this app every day, never had a problem. 
com.ichi2.anki#170777:	   Idk how I feel about this. Its good but my saved cards on last for 3-5 days before it restarts itself. It keeps crashing. If it woyld stop doing that then it would have a 5 star 
com.ichi2.anki#170780:	  Can't edit decks properties since the material update. EDIT: thanks for pointing me to the doc but I know how to edit deck properties, it just crashes. After a few more tests I realized note editing is also very buggy. If I want to edit a note, after pressing the tick button it says that the app crashed, it restarts and my edition was lost. EDIT2: checking database did not work. The edit note crashes when editing it WHILE IN REVIEW MODE, don't know if it helps. 
com.ichi2.anki#170786:	   Love the dark theme, but screen flashes white when going between flashcards. Please fix! 
com.ichi2.anki#170788:	   When I click on atach file or advanced edit mode.. The app crashes immediately 
com.ichi2.anki#170805:	   I downloaded a deck but the audio is not working on my phone. how do I fix this? 
com.ichi2.anki#170808:	   The app works well for language learning. I would give it 5 stars but I can't because I couldn't find an option to change font size in font settings. I do it in edit decks and change numbers in codes. I don't understand why it is not available, though manual says that there is font sizes option in settings. Overall the settings could be organized better. Another issue, I couldn't flip sides of cards, when for instance I want to see Chinese characters at first instead of Pinyin. Please fix them. 
com.ichi2.anki#170812:	   Love anki, love this app. By far the best most customisable flashcard app out there. I've literally spent 40+ hours designing, building, and redesigning decks for my study of Amharic. I even use the card browser as my own personal dictionary. You will need the desktop version as well if you plan to build your own decks. My previous review citing a "notification bug" turned out to be my misunderstanding of the widget. 
com.ichi2.anki#170828:	   I use it daily. It has never crashed, not once. Updated regularly, syncs flawlessly over every single device I own. New beautiful design. Hundreds of useful add ons. This is by far the best app for learning that has ever been created. 
com.ichi2.anki#170831:	    update, fixed everything I didn't like. Anki is the best program to quickly and efficiently learn new topics. 
com.ichi2.anki#170832:	   This app used to work fine, but ever since the major UI update, it's a complete train wreck. It takes over a minute for the app to start despite the fact that I've disabled automatic synchronisation etc. Half the time, the app won't come up at all but crashes outright. I appreciate the work and effort that went into these updates, but it would have been better to test this code a little longer before releasing it. Its current state, the app is virtually unusable. 
com.ichi2.anki#170836:	   Auto-sync sucks too, why not sync on background while I'm learning stuff? 
com.ichi2.anki#170845:	   The new version of Anki looks great. However, type in cards are not working properly. Whenever I touch the box to type, the keyboard pops up over the box and I'm unable to see what I am typing. Also, scrolling is not smooth like last version. Please fix this. I have edited my comment because the problem is now fixed. Anki is the best flash card app developed by the best team in the world. :) 
com.ichi2.anki#170848:	  Such a huge learning curve to use this. Really could not get it to work. Too many versions out there. I would rather make paper flashcards. Subscript: Mine stopped working. 
com.ichi2.anki#170859:	   I liked this app, but since the update it produces an error and closes immediately. I cannot send a bug report, because the program won't open to get one. 
com.ichi2.anki#170870:	  Thanks ! I used the previous version of ankidroid and my collection's format is ank2 and in the new version collection's format is apkg. So I cant import my cards into program , how can I fix this problem? 
com.ichi2.anki#170873:	   Before the update I was able yo upscale the font no problem for reviews, but now I can't and it's very hard to see Kanji. I'll up my rating if this is fixed but as of now I have to have my nose to the screen, practically. 
com.ichi2.anki#170876:	   I like new design, by the way, the app is great! But there was good statistics about how many new and review cards has a deck, I can't find it now. :( 
com.ichi2.anki#170880:	  New version is a lot slower than previous ones. If u omit that problem itsr still great as it was. 
com.ichi2.anki#170884:	   I can't do anything without it encountering a problem and sending an error report. It was always sending an error report. 
com.ichi2.anki#170891:	   General settings are not accessible (bug that stops program); therefore I cannot access the longtime awaited auto-synch functionality. The coloured answer buttons look childish and are distracting, against the minimalistic clean interface that was distinctive of this app. 
com.ichi2.anki#170896:	   It's a good application to learn every thing you want. Ofcourse it has some problem, specially in randomization of showing the notes. But still it is one of the best. 
com.ichi2.anki#170915:	  bug with the newest version. 
com.ichi2.anki#170932:	  BUGS: 1. exporting a deck resets this deck's local settings 2. "new cards in order added" setting makes user at first learn words the last ones that were added to the deck instead of the oldest ones, that are supposed to be easier to start with HOW TO create a new deck with switched direction of learning (front with cover)? 
com.ichi2.anki#170933:	   The browser button crashes the app every time. In need of an update 
com.ichi2.anki#170934:	  My cards are all gone now. it's a great app but pls fix 
com.ichi2.anki#170937:	   everytime ive tried to anything more complex then using the basic function of the app it has without fail cocked up massively, most recently it succesfully deleted all cards in my 3000 card deck when trying to sync and now refuses to import the backup i made. honestly, the best feature of anki is the decks and they are user created. if i could use the decks in any other software, i would. 
com.ichi2.anki#170938:	  I love anki, but this app have bug 
com.ichi2.anki#170940:	  Unfortunately I didn't get on with this app - it's ambitiously featured but too complex for me. I just wanted to review decks when I wanted not when the app allowed me to. I couldn't access them, it kept telling me that study was up to date. There was an option marked custom study but it still wouldn't let me access them. Then they sent me an email complaining that I wasn't using it enough so they were going to delete my account. That was the end of that. Thank you open source team for responding and I've read your link, which seems to echo my comments exactly. I was indeed frustrated, not wanting or being able to use spaced repetition because I just wanted to learn flashcards during random down-time. 
com.ichi2.anki#170942:	   I started using it on pc first, then on mobile. I just can't find any flaw to it. I JUST LOVE IT!! 
com.ichi2.anki#170943:	  Getting really sick of randomly getting prompted to log in, just to get an error that my (correct) login info is wrong. 
com.ichi2.anki#170949:	   Absolutely fabulous, I love learning languages with it. Two minor problems prevent it from having five stars: statistics are a bit too complicated but they don't show all relevant info, and it is quite a steep learning curve to get the most use out of it. 
com.ichi2.anki#170961:	  Love this. But I'm having a problem adding picture, sound, and text to cards. AnkiDroid card editor only lets me add one type of answer on the back (Basic card version). It will display multiple answer types on cards made on the Windows Desktop software. Would really love to be able to add cards from the Android version with multipe (sound/picture/text) answers! 
com.ichi2.anki#170963:	   For some decks I want to learn in the deck's natural order, but for others I want a random order. At the moment when you change the order of a single deck it seems to affect all installed decks - even though the setting is found within deck options - so you have to reconfigure it every time you switch between decks. In fact, in spite of doing this, it is now giving me cards from the wrong part of the deck. I wish there was some way you could fix the cards it's giving you if it somehow goes wrong like this. 
com.ichi2.anki#170973:	   I love this app . simple and great for studying but the problem is if you have a large database on sd card and an unrooted Android 4.4 or 5 since this app don't have write access to SD card it will keep crashing while trying to write to SD card. I had to downgrade my Android just for this app. 
com.ichi2.anki#170975:	  Crashes in Marshmallow 
com.ichi2.anki#170977:	  My life pretty much revolves around this app. I spend hours on it daily adding and reviewing cards. Anki has all the features I ever need to use and has never crashed on me for the 2+ years I've used it. My only question is... will you guys ever change the logo? 
com.ichi2.anki#170981:	   Wouldn't download. Just kept stopping. Nothing wrong with my connection as downloaded all other apps fine. 
com.ichi2.anki#170992:	   This is a very good basic flashcard app. It's not flashy or very customizable but overall dependable. The only issue right now is that the app crashes when I try to start a custom study session. Please fix 
com.ichi2.anki#170994:	  Sort out the bugs before you publish it 
com.ichi2.anki#170995:	  Fantastic app! Very well made, super useful! Have never had a problem with it. It's wonderful! Thanks to the team who made it! 
com.ichi2.anki#171000:	  I didn't get it. I started with my collection, added two words, wanted also reversed form. Reverse is not as attribute, it adds new words (?), but in the list it shows A-B A-A C-D C-C ?? When I open A-A I see A-B. What I expected is A-B B-A C-D D-C. The study didn't work better. 
com.ichi2.anki#171002:	  You'll spend as much time trying to set up this app and to work around all the bugs as you'll actually spend learning your target knowledge. It's highly customizable and all that, but it's almost as if the developer has made it as infuriatingly difficult as possible to set up and use. Something as simple as a 'Browse' button to change the import (sorry, the "collection") path, for example, would make things so much easier. Instead, you need to type it all in, and it's even CASE SENSITIVE, for God's sake! It's like pre GUI nostalgia or something. There's no rhyme or reason to it. Audio files don't sync. The list of problems and flaws is endless. Potentially, a wonderful learning tool, but actually barely usable. 
com.ichi2.anki#171008:	   This app helps me not forget the foreign languages I have been studying! 
com.ichi2.anki#171026:	   Great and amazing app ! One recommendation: on the night mode it switches not just the white with black but also other font colors. For example: the Red becomes Turquoise, Green -&gt; Purple. That color scheme change affect the memorization because a lot of the time, different font colors carries additional information. Just use the algorithm that changes white to black while keeping the other colors intact. That would work great. Please fix. I will give 5 stars right after that update :-) 
com.ichi2.anki#171034:	  Would not late me download. Error 921 
com.ichi2.anki#171037:	   I like it and want to use it, but crashes every few flashcards. Please look into this. I would like to give 4 stars if not crashing! 
com.ichi2.anki#171055:	   Much improvement since I first got it way back when. Still some confusing interface issues, but features more than make up for it. 
com.ichi2.anki#171066:	   I am using this to study Greek. When I use the computer app, it works well, but the android app syncs the Greek words incorrectly by leaving out certain letters in the middle of words making it impossible to study. Please fix this or tell me what I'm doing wrong! 
com.ichi2.anki#171097:	   As other have stated, it's a great app and a very powerful tool. The only issue I'm having is that it doesn't notify my when cards are due. I'm very used to this from my Wanikani apps and it means that my cards that are due to be reviewed will be reviewed late, possibly interfering with the SRS process. Notifications don't appear unless I've manually opened the app, even if I hadn't closed it since last opened. I also wish it was a bit prettier and more motivating, like Wanikani somehow is. 
com.ichi2.anki#171099:	   Except when I work flashcard the edit is not saved ultimately. 
com.ichi2.anki#171101:	   I can't seem to point it to my /storage/extSdCard/AnkiDroid location for SD card storage. Is there a known bug? I sent the crash report. 
com.ichi2.anki#171102:	   For about 2 years I've been using SuperMemo, and struggling with incompatibilities, bugs, complications, non-portability, etc. This app's a wonder. Now I can truly say I can (almost) "forget about forgetting." ^_^ 
com.ichi2.anki#171105:	  Only issue is I wish there was a solution to the maximum number of media files issue in the Android file system 
com.ichi2.anki#171114:	   I love the app but once I've opened it, my battery is rapidly drained on my S3 even if I close the app afterwards. I've seen a few people post with this problem but have yet to see a solution. 
com.ichi2.anki#171121:	   Too bad, used this app for a long time, but it no longer works. Crashes on startup even after reinstall 
com.ichi2.anki#171129:	   I haven't had any problems at all, great to learn, doesn't use much battery, all the images look great. Best way to practice and learn on the go 
com.ichi2.anki#171185:	  It is not good. It doesn't work. 
com.ichi2.anki#171192:	   Thank you for fixing my audio problem. Great work. Help me learn Mandarin a lot! 
com.ichi2.anki#171197:	  Life saver app, but... It doesn't notificate how many cards I have due unless I open the app. What good is that? Also I keep deleting notes with audio and image but the space used by ankidroid in miscelaneous storage doesn't get smaller. The same thing in ankiweb, my space there doesn't get smaller even after synchronization. 
com.ichi2.anki#171201:	   Using for more than a year and With the latest update, all small issues too has been fixed!!!! 
com.ichi2.anki#171205:	  When I first used Anki, my different devices would not sync up with each other even though they were listed as supported devices. But now my devices happily sync up my custom and shared decks, so I have no complaints- it's fast, convenient, makes learning make sense, and gives you more types of feedback on your studying than any other program. I love it. The online version has a prettier interface than mobile and PC, but I still love the system. 
com.ichi2.anki#171220:	   There is a strange error message saying that phone is 302 seconds off and it's not syncing 
com.ichi2.anki#171230:	   Simple and useful, but I'd really appreciate the ability to search and review cards at my discretion. In using this as a study tool, if I can't remember something that I know is in certain card, I like to be able to search for that card and go through it whenever I like. Instead, when I search for the card all I get in the answer is a scramble of code. Fix this and I'd happily pay good money for the app. Cheers! 
com.ichi2.anki#171231:	   Have been using this for years and haven't had any issues. 
com.ichi2.anki#171244:	   It doesn't matter what you're trying to learn, this app and the method it uses just works. It doesn't matter how bad your memory is, this app will fix that. The best part is that it's flexible; you can study as little or as much as you like to fit even the busiest schedule. At times, it doesn't even feel like you're learning, but you are. It's impossible to not learn and master something new when using this app. 
com.ichi2.anki#171273:	   Sync broken with latest version. Gives an error message at start, and only works with a new collection. Sync fails near 55000 kb transfered. 
com.ichi2.anki#171291:	  This is an amazing app but sync fail problem still exists. 
com.ichi2.anki#171306:	  It was great until it would not let me study the cards when I want regardless of what I did in the settings. It also stopped ,etc from looking at any flashcards that I made. I could not use them when I needed to. 
com.ichi2.anki#171310:	   ...none of the packs I want will download! I've tried each one several times and everytime I get the "Download failed" notification 
com.ichi2.anki#171318:	  Im giving five stars because this app was extremely helpful for quickly and easily learning new things. However, I installed the app on my new phone and there were problems: I could only add cards to the default deck and I couldnt import my previous decks from my external sd card. 
com.ichi2.anki#171322:	   The app is amazing. The only issue I have is it seems like it can't import anything other than .apkg format files. I need to import .anki files often and its kind of annoying having to run them through my desktop before they can be used on my smartphone 
com.ichi2.anki#171344:	  It is the best application for educational purposes. However, i encountered one problem, my questions involving images dont get synchronised . I have anki on my laptop and cellphone. The images are only in my cellphone and in laptop it opens without images. How can i fix this ? 
com.ichi2.anki#171347:	   This is by far the best educational app I've come across. The functionality is superb n the customisation options are simply incredible. Along with the desktop version you can simply learn anything you want to. Only problem I've been facing is that everytime I try to edit a card on my phone, the app goes a little crazy n does not save my changes. 
com.ichi2.anki#171360:	   Every time I try to sync after the update I get an error. Please fix, thank you! Other than that great app I use it all the time and I've been successful with it. 
com.ichi2.anki#171364:	   It has everything what I need. I've been using it for more than 2 years and except one crisis (crashed and I lost progress for several months) everything was good. It definitely worths for the 5* rating! 
com.ichi2.anki#171368:	   I used to be able to fix import mistakes quickly with the swap function (not create a reverse card) 
com.ichi2.anki#171375:	   March 2015 update just broke cloze deletion, it shows the cloze twice, once with [...] and once with the answer already there now. Now I can't study that deck until it's fixed... 
com.ichi2.anki#171380:	   I used this application for about two years and it was fantastic. However, now that I have changed my phone, the application will not download correctly. I'm unable to download and of the decks that I have saved to my account. 
com.ichi2.anki#171385:	   Fixed problem. Everything works great again. Cheers! Easy five stars. 
com.ichi2.anki#171394:	   After I agreed to the new terms and conditions on the pc, the app on the phone stopped working. All I get is a loading screen with a message that a report is being sent to the developers. I tried reinstalling the app, but it hasn't helped. I'd appreciate any kind of help since this is one of the most apps on my phone. 
com.ichi2.anki#171395:	   Thanks for making this. Had a little problem at first. I think because the syncing is a bit slow, but it would claim to be all synced up but would not match what was on my computer at home. (I do have a lot of decks). Works great now. No problem at all 
com.ichi2.anki#171404:	  Cannot login to read terms 
com.ichi2.anki#171415:	   The synchronization is throwing an error every time I'm trying to synchronize my flash cards. Another limitation is the inability to add prerecorded audios. 
com.ichi2.anki#171427:	   I'm not sure if anyone else gets the same issue but 1 day after installing the app and uploadin some flashcards, the audio recordings were gone and the app doesn't let me to add audio recordings to the flashcard (recording the audio deletes the text and the audio on the card doesn't play during study). The audio played no problem the 1st day. I spent time trying to change different settings but couldn't make it work. 
com.ichi2.anki#171435:	  I can't sync because my clock is 8,000 seconds off. Are you f***ING kidding me. I thought this was a good app to study but I ended up wasting my valuable time to make 50 cards for an exam in 3 days. Your app sucks. 
com.ichi2.anki#171436:	  The desktop version has a bug when removing the note types. I'd better find a finer tool. 
com.ichi2.anki#171452:	   I was using the app for a month or so, composing over 100 cards until the app just quit one day. I tried uninstalling and redownloading, but I just get the same error message. Use a more reliable system, or risk losing all your work. 
com.ichi2.anki#171467:	   I haven't used AnkiDroid for a long time. Now I install again. I synced with my account. Then there's no sound in my AnkiDroid. Help me, please! 
com.ichi2.anki#171472:	   But I have one problem with it: GIF playback. Some of my decks have animated GIFs, and I can see them on the PC version of Anki, but I can't see them on the Android version! I would give this app 5 stars if this wasn't happening. Please fix this issue asap! 
com.ichi2.anki#171477:	   Perfect other than the colour picker missing (unless I can't find it xD) since I tend to colour code my Japanese verbs on which verb group they conjugate under, I can't actually create cards half the time on my tablet :( 
com.ichi2.anki#171483:	   Closes immediately after clicking. Says AnkiDroid encountered a problem. Please fix this. I really need to review. 
com.ichi2.anki#171490:	  the latest version crash on me! 
com.ichi2.anki#171500:	   I've lost my entire collection about nine times by now, losing anywhere from days to months worth of progress. Don't get invested in this app, it will only break your heart 
com.ichi2.anki#171502:	  Memory requirements are insane. Crashes on big dictionary import. 
com.ichi2.anki#171503:	   Nice app just some problem for use picture from the gallery. Hope you can fix that :) 
com.ichi2.anki#171505:	   There really needs to be some kind of tutorial. It took me ten minutes to figure out how to add cards to a deck. There doesn't appear to be a way to edit or delete cards if you make a mistake. I don't get ask these rules/options either. Why would you want to limit how many times you can study? I don't know what "options group" means. This is a really strangely designed app that maybe could be good of I knew what the heck was going on. Uninstall. 
com.ichi2.anki#171514:	   Even though it has some rough edges (eg it keeps crashing when increasing today's new card limit), I am amazed by the power of this app. I've been learning swedish for barely 3 weeks in spare moments (queues, bus rides and so on) and I know more than 300 words already! Basic no-frills design that gets the job done beautifully. Gotta love open source! 
com.ichi2.anki#171517:	   But be prepared to decipher what is part of the learning curve to use the program and what is just a bug. Support -- though merely volunteers -- is lacking. Some will understand the program and some won't. I guess that's one way of doing it. 
com.ichi2.anki#171537:	   I couldn't get vocab decks - or any decks at all - through the app. 
com.ichi2.anki#171555:	   Used with Anki on my PC. Recent updates have ironed out a few minor issues with syncing. Currently 13,000 cards in one deck with no performance issues. Recommended 
com.ichi2.anki#171557:	   This is an amazing app, it makes learning kanji so easy. But there is one problem. I can not delete decks or single cards, I'm not sure if deleting cards is an option but deleting a deck is. But I still will not let me do it. Please fix this. 
com.ichi2.anki#171559:	   Previously I had given 5 star but now 3 for one simple issue. The reviewed cards tend to become INFECTED!.infected cards turn itself INVISIBLE during review.its like reviewing EMPTY cards.In anki's last update,this issue was fixed but now it is recurring.Plz fix this quickly. Except this everything is UBER! 
com.ichi2.anki#171563:	   It has some bugs but as it's free i have to say it's much better than other similars like keep in head or jmemorize 
com.ichi2.anki#171564:	  This app sucks you can't get cards I would rate a zero if I could!!!!!!!!!!! 
com.ichi2.anki#171568:	   Ever since the latest or one of the latest versions, the number of new cards and to be reviewed cards will sometimes seemingly randomly get reset while doing my reviews (usually somewhere near the end...). This is a very frustrating bug. Please fix it. Otherwise, great app. 
com.ichi2.anki#171569:	   The app is very useful to me, but please, make it autosync at some interval, or after every study session, or when you exit it. I didn't know I have to manually sync it every time, so when I open my laptop app, it doesn't know what I have studied and if I continue, I not only waste time, but probably risk loosing data or crashing the spacing algorithm 
com.ichi2.anki#171574:	   Systematic memorization so you don't forget the essential details 
com.ichi2.anki#171578:	   Will change when fixed. 
com.ichi2.anki#171581:	   Its too complicated, the ui is not helpful at all. And you can't synchronize your cards with PC. There is no login option on the PC version 
com.ichi2.anki#171585:	   This app seriously rocks! You learn stuff without making an effort! I have been using this app almost for a year now and update after update the features get better, for example, i love the whiteboard feature they have just added. It used to crash before a couple of times a week, but now it works like magic on my cellphone. 
com.ichi2.anki#171588:	   Doesn't work. Added items couldn't find! 
com.ichi2.anki#171600:	   Useful, powerful, flexible, efficient, and a must have tool. I study any chance I have with it, a minute here and there. filtered decks, custom note types, easy content manipulation, make this an ideal and important tool to have. Bugs! It's also important that it can do its job. Some android versions, html rendering crashes after 50 cards, the old version is not allowed to synchronize, the new version has modal dialogs for error reporting and synchronization progress which are invisible... 
com.ichi2.anki#171601:	   I decided to use Anki since my friend suggested it. But I couldnt download it for my Galaxy Tab 3. Hope you guys can help to fix 
com.ichi2.anki#171604:	   Repeating is not works ??? 
com.ichi2.anki#171605:	   Spent hours making cards and for what? For it to crash EVERY single time I try and study them! Time to go to quizlet! 
com.ichi2.anki#171610:	   Have had problems but a very good app! Perfect for learning languages 
com.ichi2.anki#171646:	   Crashed whenever I tried to login 
com.ichi2.anki#171651:	  Cloze overlapping doesn't work. Update: issue 2329. 
com.ichi2.anki#171663:	   The program is magnificent! The great job guys! BUT there has been a problem with synchronisation since the last version. When I revise sth on mobile, then sync, correct sth on the computer, sync, and want to sync it on mobile, some error occurs and I have to revise again. Please repair it asap. Best regards. 
com.ichi2.anki#171675:	   Allows me to study anki wherever I go, since I'm not always near my computer. Doesn't seem to have many bugs either! 
com.ichi2.anki#171685:	   I use this app all days, for the last 3 years. It has a few bugs, but it is helping me learn lots of stuff. 
com.ichi2.anki#171695:	   New version has some bug. Whenever a card contain a photo, there is no audio or text includes. When I click "show answer" there is also nothing appearing. Please fix it. 
com.ichi2.anki#171697:	   With the latest update, audio recording on flash cards stop working. Looks like the audio files are not saved. 
com.ichi2.anki#171698:	   I love the look and feel of this app, low rating because pictures will not show up on the cards on my galaxy s4:/ will change when fixed 
com.ichi2.anki#171702:	   The bug I had reported in my previous review regarding images breaking cards was noticed and patched in the latest beta on github. Great software and developers. 
com.ichi2.anki#171707:	  Audio does not work 
com.ichi2.anki#171724:	   cannot get decks, just failed 
com.ichi2.anki#171731:	   Would not read my question or save it uggg do not get 
com.ichi2.anki#171744:	   I wanted to export my entire collection, including my review history so that I can import it to my desktop but unfortunately I can't find the Export menu. I'm using AnkiDroid version 2.2.3. 
com.ichi2.anki#171758:	   Searching for shared decks just got really irritating. It resizes everything so you can't read and if you rotate your phone you have to start all over. Please fix this. 
com.ichi2.anki#171764:	   Keep getting java.lang.RuntimeException FileNotFoundException: /storage/emulated/0/AnkiDroid/tmpSyncServer.zip: open failed: ENOENT (No such file or directory) error when trying to sync with Anki on my mac? 
com.ichi2.anki#171781:	   It has been a very useful tool for me as I'm learning new English vocabulary everyday and all the time. The bad thing is that it suddenly disappeared from my phone, I couldn't understand why! And because of an error "-110" I can't install it again. 
com.ichi2.anki#171799:	   EDIT:  app for anki, which is the best way to memorise anything. Still not a 'pretty' app, but looks a lot nicer since the most recent update. Couldn't find the bury card function but developer helpfully explained where this had disappeared to (under the dismiss card button) - thanks! PREV REVIEW: Functionality seems to have been lost in recent update - how do you bury a card now? 
com.ichi2.anki#171813:	   Never crashes, does what it sets out to do. 
com.ichi2.anki#171817:	   I can't download media on my cards. Also the app claims to download heaps of data when I know that I have hardly any cards 
com.ichi2.anki#171838:	   Don't get this if you are not planning on getting the (also free) desktop app. This app is for people who really want to push their learning further. There are very few features which Anki does not have, though it may take a while to figure out how to use them to their fullest potential. The investment is absolutely 100 percent worth it! This program is built for those who wish to be excellent students, and to retain information long after the exam is finished. 
com.ichi2.anki#171845:	   The app wants me to "cloze" something but I don't want to . Fix it then I will rate 5 stars 
com.ichi2.anki#171853:	   It's a good app but its been crashing alot lately while im simply trying to review notecards 
com.ichi2.anki#171871:	   It works! I've been using AnkiDroid for a psychopathology course in which I have to memorize huge amounts of diagnostic criteria, and it's helping a ton. I haven't run into any bugs, the synchronization is fast and easy so I can enter the flashcards on my laptop but also review them on my phone. I'd appreciate a more straightforward way to run it in "cram mode" (review everything, regardless of the memory-aiding algorithm), but it's a quick workaround on the user's end. Thanks for making a great, quality product with no ads! 
com.ichi2.anki#171881:	   Great idea and almost flawless app. Only some occasional sync problems. 
com.ichi2.anki#171888:	   This used to be my favorite app. Its very useful for studying. Now every card I add says edit this note. I spent two hours making these cards and when I went to study them, I couldn't because they all said edit this note. I have never had this problem with a flashcard app before. It's my flashcards and I wrote everything how I wanted to. I don't see why I would have to edit anything to study. 
com.ichi2.anki#171895:	  Great app! Be sure to verify any public decks for accuracy. Found an error in the multiplication facts deck. 
com.ichi2.anki#171901:	   The application is very useful. However, it has one annoying bug, which should be removed - if a part of word (let's say in target language) is marked in other colour, this word cannot be found using search method, because the part of word marked in other colour is not visible. 
com.ichi2.anki#171903:	   I like the new interface and the dampening of background music is a very nice added feature. However, the new "Finding changed media" is very inefficient. It now takes 5 minutes to perform a sync even when nothing has changed. Until now, I had no major issues. 
com.ichi2.anki#171911:	   Hi. I had an technical issue when after updating the app. If anyone has the same issue- maybe my small 'guide' can help My JPEG images in cards have shrunk. How did I solve the problem? Went to SETTINGS, then to advanced, then checked off SIMPLE INTERFACE and all was o.k. 
com.ichi2.anki#171914:	   Wouldn't let me paste words when am editing an already saved flash card. Crashed when I wanted to insert media. Deletes all what I typed in during flash card creation when I minimize app. Might have to try other flash cards 
com.ichi2.anki#171922:	   Anki crashes on Sony Xperia E1 when trying to create a new deck and a message about "SD card not mounted" appears. 
com.ichi2.anki#171923:	   With this open source app you can learn anything which could broken down to small pieces of information very effectively. I also use open source GoldenDic app which work greatly with Ankidroid. Not to mention there is a great responsive support team which respond promptly on your problems. Thanks to Ankidroid team for their job. 
com.ichi2.anki#171944:	   Hello. When anki 2 was introduced there was some kind of heated debate about the fact that all the media files are stocked in one folder. It is quite problematic for anki power users, since most of our decks consist of many more sounds then just 15-17 thousand that fat32 can fit in. Is there any progress on somehow resolving this issue (for example keeping all the media files in a zip file? 
com.ichi2.anki#171947:	   Please do something about the the image addition thing.It isn't working.Other apps I've checked out have no issues with this.When this is done, then it's straight to 5 star rating. 
com.ichi2.anki#171954:	  Won't work with Nexus 7 
com.ichi2.anki#171960:	   Will not synchonise with note 10 2014 
com.ichi2.anki#171967:	   New cards are still created always in the first (wrong) deck and not in the selected one. Pls fix! Otherwise very useful app. 
com.ichi2.anki#171969:	   While some of the changes are refreshing, there are some brand new problems. The placement of the undo button is now inconvenient and the removal of the swap button was unnecessary. In addition, add no longer remembers your tags from the last time. Finally, 'Add' and 'Close' have been swapped round. They are now completely contrary to expectations (even if Add is now closer to the thumb). 
com.ichi2.anki#171996:	   You Sir/madam, are a hero. Really, the updates made this app usable for me. Edit: Just did an intensive play with the TTS, posted on Google codes just now, it's working but with bugs... But the instant add/save data doesn't work for me! (using golden dict). Also couldn't manage to activate look up(for golden dict), haha. 
com.ichi2.anki#172005:	   Upping my review from two to four stars after the recent bug fix release. Excellent app for learning languages. 
com.ichi2.anki#172013:	   It was a total blessing until a bunch of my cards didn't work. 
com.ichi2.anki#172018:	   this app constantly crashes! fix the latest version! 
com.ichi2.anki#172021:	   Does the job perfectly. Absolutely no stability issues so far. 
com.ichi2.anki#172026:	   I love anki and use it all the time on my desktop, but the mobel version is a huge failure. I cant sync my decks because I keep getting bogus errors that there isnt enough room on my device when I have 6 free GB. Further I cant manually delete said decks because the app crashes during the delete. When it works it is great, but unfortunatly it doesnt work more than it does. And no ammount of deleting the app and its dats helps. 
com.ichi2.anki#172056:	   I use Anki on my laptop. Love the software! When I first got the app, it would always crash on me when I undo and now seems to be fine. The app allows you to sync to AnkiWeb so you can keep your progress on the cloud. I'm having some issues with sync from my Nexus to the cloud though. I'm forced to overwrite my progress from Android to cloud whenever I try to sync. 
com.ichi2.anki#172057:	   The sounds don't work. I have a moto x. How can I fix the sounds? 
com.ichi2.anki#172059:	  The very existence of this app being free is 5 stars. I am stilk not used to Anki, but I will be soon! 
com.ichi2.anki#172064:	   I love Anki and have been using it on my Mac for awhile, so I was really excited to find an app on my phone for it, but every time I open the app it immediately crashes =( I have an evo 4G. Please let me know if anyone else has this problem. 
com.ichi2.anki#172067:	   Awful. Crashes after 10 mins of studying. But the worst part is that it reset the counter for 'new' words so you're constantly getting new words like it was a brand new day after every crash. I wasted so much time before I realized it. I should've known not to trust a third party app. 
com.ichi2.anki#172073:	   I use this all the time for school to memorize Japanese, and it's gotten to the point where I've made over a thousand cards myself. I wanted to just study from one of the pre-made shared decks, but Anki just can't handle the sheet amount of cards. Although Anki is very good once you figure out how to use it, the Android version is lacking in that you can't have large decks or the app will crash. Is there any way you guys can fix this problem? 
com.ichi2.anki#172079:	   The app doesn't open. 
com.ichi2.anki#172087:	   I am a medical student preparing for USMLE and i use this program more than all other apps together. But, I think the app lacks some features, like: 1- Some times I need to exclude some decks from the search process, but this feature is not there. 2- I cant "multi select" items in the search list, as sometimes i need to delete many cards, and takes alot!!! of time to do it. 3- Seems perfect if it is enabled to merge decks. These are the major problems I faced. If they've been solved, I'll be very good.. 
com.ichi2.anki#172091:	  The one and only flashcard app, highly recommended. Note: Ankidroid on Android 4.4 cannot show custom fonts, requesting a bug fix 
com.ichi2.anki#172093:	  App is great but crashes and makes my phone to reboot... 
com.ichi2.anki#172097:	  I like the idea of the app, but there are so many issues. If you get it right twice you have to wait a day to review the word again. So I tried saying I got all them wrong so I could review then whenever I wanted. After you get more than one wrong it will just constantly go back to the words you got wrong; preventing you from practicing other. It also goes in the order that they were added. So as I'm reviewing them more and more, because of memory I can see one word and know what the next word will be. 
com.ichi2.anki#172105:	   A very good app for learning. Only one thing to complain: media files (mp3, images) are not removed when I delete decks. That costs storage of my SD card. 
com.ichi2.anki#172106:	   I love Anki and use it to study Chinese. However, in the last few days Anki has decided to invert the colour scheme as soon as I start a study session, which is troublesome because I use colour as a memory aid. Fix this, and it's five stars! Edit 19/05 - Thanks for the quick response, five stars it is! 
com.ichi2.anki#172108:	   Dear Anki team, The pinch and zoom doesn't work at all. I've tried this on other devices and they also don't work. I'm currently running 4.2 with latest Anki. Hope this can get fixed asap. Thanks. 
com.ichi2.anki#172110:	   One bug. I have a note with two fields. Both use a cloze set to 1 like this. F1={{c1:foo}} and F2={{c1:bar}}. The windows app is OK with this and shows both as {{...}}. This version only shows the first correct. The second is broken. Still a 5 star app for anyone considering the download. 
com.ichi2.anki#172119:	    generally but there are issues as well. Links such as the shared deck page and just signing in to review a deck don't work. The website is so simple that it's useless. I also can't delete a deck or choose to make decks dormant. The custom study doesn't work or perhaps none of the decks are tagged. And finally, between the website and the app, it feels like there is a massive community using this that i am unable to access. 
com.ichi2.anki#172122:	   First, I want to thank for your great app. It makes and keeps my brain perfect with words until I get all them right. However, I could just spend enough time on it for the first month. When words built up abundant, I just had time to review the very previous words and couldn't learn the new added words. That's because I didn't get the previous words right in a few attempts; then it turned to have short cycle of reviewing like new added words. I hope I can create separate decks of different days/topics.Then 
com.ichi2.anki#172124:	   Title says it all... Update: after the update hebrew fonts are no lobger supported unless you turn on vowel points. Even if you copy fonts to the media folder it does not work. I let them know about this issue. 
com.ichi2.anki#172126:	   The app crashes every time I try to edit a card while I'm studying it. 
com.ichi2.anki#172129:	   Love it! Previous issue with card creation got fixed, thanks! 
com.ichi2.anki#172137:	   , confusing, back up deck does not import into the app once accidentally deleted. Won't sync decks to my account. Not worth the hassle. 
com.ichi2.anki#172139:	   This app is great, but one problem is very prominent. When I use android dark theme with night mode, the background becomes white after I answer one question and before the next card is loaded. It would be better if the intervening screen it's black or off other dark colours. * This problem appears to be fixed. 
com.ichi2.anki#172147:	   I use this app every day. I am a big fan of the desktop version and was excited to find this mobile app. I love how easy it is to make my own decks and find this really helps in the learning process (vs using premade decks that often contain errors). The mobile cards look and work well and I have no complaints. 
com.ichi2.anki#172156:	   Working good, finally. I am getting the occasional crash but a sensible backup strategy makes this easy to bear. I don't like the sync function though as it's very slow here in China, especially if you are trying to sync your entire media collection. I explored different ways to sync over USB, most of them causing AnkiDroid to crash for no apparent reason. At the time of this review Google have decided (very stupidly) to remove the USB Mass Storage file transfer protocol in favour of MTP, which is huge pile of odorous excrement. My plan was to use BeyondCompare (a folder comparison tool for Windows) to sync my Anki media. This is not possible with MTP, which forces you to use Anki's built-in sync function. Then I tried several USB Mass Storage enabling apps, some of which worked but AnkiDroid was crashing all the time. All the problems seemed to go away after I installed the latest version of BusyBox and and app called SG USB Mass Storage Enabler. Now I am able to manage my collection from my PC and I am very happy with the results. I hope Google consider re-adding USB Mass Storage mode though. MTP is retarded. 
com.ichi2.anki#172165:	  One star till they fix downloading decks 
com.ichi2.anki#172175:	   After downloading around 12%, it shows an error, INVALID DOWNLOAD URL. Dnt knw why... 
com.ichi2.anki#172176:	  Crashes when opening cards with embedded images. 
com.ichi2.anki#172177:	  Doesn't open on S3 LTE with the last two updates. 
com.ichi2.anki#172213:	  Great app, but the latest update made italics on cards stop working. 
com.ichi2.anki#172228:	   It took a long time to fix this bug, but now everything works perfectly. Great! 
com.ichi2.anki#172231:	  App does not work with a Nook HD in its unrooted state. All I did was to install the app and start it. It just quit saying, 'Unfortunately the app stopped,' or something to that effect. Uninstall, reboot, reintall did not fix the issue. 
com.ichi2.anki#172238:	  I love this! Will now not fail my AP U.S. History test~nHowever, I wish there were instructions - I still haven't figured out how to add decks. 
com.ichi2.anki#172240:	   I had an issue with my install. Freak accident and heard back within 24 hours. Now couldnt be hapier with the product. 
com.ichi2.anki#172256:	   I've been having trouble with the majority of my custom cards telling me to edit them and add cloze notations. They are not the sort of flash cards that need this, so I don't know if I messed up in the making or if the program is giving me issues. I can't fix the issue without deleting and redoing all the messed up cards, which is a huge waste of time I don't have. 
com.ichi2.anki#172262:	   Very good features for study. But start, opening cards, and syncing are slow. At times, it causes the system to crash entirely on Android 4.2.2. Hope these can be fixed. 
com.ichi2.anki#172272:	   Couldn't register for an account l kept getting an error message therefore I couldn't sync my flaschcards.....waste of time. Unistalling 
com.ichi2.anki#172278:	   It sometimes crashes when I open it. Not a big deal. Otherwise great app! 
com.ichi2.anki#172301:	   Hi. I love this app and Im hoping to use it again. Recently, my app won't work because I have less than 10mb on my SD card. However, I don't have a SD card for my phone. I am pretty annoyed the fact that I have to buy a SD card just to start this app program. Are there any way for me to fix this problem? 
com.ichi2.anki#172303:	   Features sound great but the app constantly crashes. I created a new deck but it won't let me create any cards before it crashes! Totally useless. 
com.ichi2.anki#172318:	   Excellent application. Only problem is that I tend to use the cram feature more than the default one. Another complaint is the lack of auto rotation when flipping through cards. Still a great application that has no advertisements and is very handy. The synchronization function is a life saver. 
com.ichi2.anki#172324:	   Fixed, effectively 
com.ichi2.anki#172328:	   There seems to be a problem with tags, one you create them their name cannot be changed and you cannot delete them either 
com.ichi2.anki#172331:	   I've used anki and ankidroid for a long time. After a recent update it crashes on both phones after a couple of cards. 
com.ichi2.anki#172336:	   This app works great and very useful! The only minor problem I have encountered is with the zoom on screen icons. When the zoom option is checked, the zoom icons sometimes cover the written text. It is better to make those icons invisible unless you touch the screen, or just cancel them, as pinch works fine with zooming. 
com.ichi2.anki#172341:	  Good and helpful app to memorize things. But crashes every time I want to review earlier and open the setting. I'd give one more star if that can be fixed. Great app overall. 
com.ichi2.anki#172349:	   Since the previous update the night mode is not working properly anymore. Black background is changing to white in between cards. 
com.ichi2.anki#172360:	   The best app ever, absolutely essential for me. But the last update broke the zoom feature & I used to have images fit to the width of the screen when on landscape Mode, but now it stays at the same size regardless of orientation. ... Please solve those issues as the images have text that isn't readable on GS4 unless zoomed in. 
com.ichi2.anki#172394:	   Cumbersome, unintuitive, and dull. Inserting picture is displayed in the preview images but can't find actual option. Over complicated. 
com.ichi2.anki#172422:	   I had a problem with my deck, I lost it. I contacted Ankidroid, and they responded immediately. I didn't respond immediately, they followed up. In answering their questions about my problem, I figured it out. Love, love, love. Somehow, the flashcards seem to only appear in a way that I actually learn them, even though I put in a couple hundred at once. Again, love, love, love! 
com.ichi2.anki#172436:	   has some problems. And I don't understand how to set number of steps. I want only two lowest steps. 
com.ichi2.anki#172447:	   The desktop app is very good, but this mobile app crashes on image heavy cards. I have sent an automatically generated error report on this. 
com.ichi2.anki#172449:	   Have been using this program for years as my mainstay for learning. Problem with this latest ankidroid update in that you cannot zoom into pictures properly. 
com.ichi2.anki#172454:	   Makes it easier to learn Japanese. After the last update it worked like magic. Thanks for quick fix! 
com.ichi2.anki#172461:	   Getting more crashes and errors with the latest version. I'm unable to sync now. 
com.ichi2.anki#172462:	   Worked fine before (only 1 crash in many weeks), now I get "opening collection" after 5-10 cards. Terribly annoying. 
com.ichi2.anki#172467:	   I'm DONE with this program. For one, it doesn't allow cramming. When you finish a deck, you have FINISHED that deck for the day. I couldn't figure out how to reset it to let me study the words again. Which brings me to two, the program is unnecessary complicated. I used sticky kanji to study for the JLPT and while I couldn't make my own flashcards, I didn't need to read anything to start using it. It just worked. Finally, the last straw. I go to make a deck for my final exam and it tells me my entries are in other decks. I can't have duplicates. It's okay, Anki, I want doubles, this is my compilation deck. No? YOU WON'T ALLOW ME? What kind of programmer make s program that won't let me use it? I am not going to search for and move my old cards. Oh and that option to try to keep pairs apart from one another? Doesn't work very well at all. I'm just really annoyed right now. 
com.ichi2.anki#172487:	   If it takes me more than a few minutes to figure out how to randomize flashcards in a FLASHCARD APP and I have to google it there's a basic failure in the intention of what one uses flashcards for 
com.ichi2.anki#172496:	   Unknown error during application installation error 919...:-( 
com.ichi2.anki#172500:	   I am using the app since nearly one year to learn Slovak. I am syncing to the web mainly for backup reasons. Never had a problem. Have more than a thousand cards and have improved my vocabulary significantly. My teacher is also very happy. :) great app. Thanks. 
com.ichi2.anki#172506:	   I'm so sad. After downloading the new version of this app, I can no longer study as much as I used to. I really enjoyed AnkiDroid while it was working. I used it everyday, and it really helped me to keep up with my studies. But for some reason, this new version doesn't work for me. Every time I open up a deck, the screen goes blank for about a minute, then it shuts down.  I really hope someone can help me to get this app working again before finals! 
com.ichi2.anki#172507:	   Extremely disappointed in this app. Keeps crashing! 
com.ichi2.anki#172518:	   That it can sync with the PC version is awesome! I've only used version 2 and higher and have never had any sync issues, crashes or freeze ups. The interface could use a little overhaul. The only trouble I'm having is that new notes/cards are added to the first deck I ever created and not the deck select. I use Ankidroid to increase my Japanese vocabulary. Check out Anki Aniki for the best Android app for learning kanji! 
com.ichi2.anki#172522:	   Won't sync to ankiweb from pc or Android. Was working well and really useful. Now, nothing. It either says times out or gives error message. What now.... 
com.ichi2.anki#172523:	   All the reviewing power of the desktop program with a super polished Android interface! Works beautifully for learning Japanese, and the home screen widget makes sure you don't forget to study everyday. 
com.ichi2.anki#172533:	   Couldn't find reset progress option. Can I do this without PC? 
com.ichi2.anki#172546:	   I was able to add cards to the decks, but now I'm unable to even view the cards, let alone study. Please fix this issue. Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 
com.ichi2.anki#172552:	   I can not sync from mob to ankiweb but can receive from ankiweb . cellphone model is : Xperia SL 
com.ichi2.anki#172567:	   This program is marvelous, especially when used in tandem with the desktop app. I can make cards with [$]CONTENT[/$] in them on my laptop and it shows up fine. But I can't get cards with [LATEX]CONTENT[/LATEX] to show up on my phone, even though it shows up on ankiweb and on my arch Linux AAO desktop just fine. A marvelous program. 
com.ichi2.anki#172570:	   It doesn't save the cards you spend hours typing 
com.ichi2.anki#172573:	   would be excellent, if hadn't CRASH almost every single time I use it (I always send the crash reports, and it says "known issue, pending investigation" so, will you fix it please?) 
com.ichi2.anki#172575:	   It's good app, but today I can't continue my process because app crashed. Nexus 4, error log sent. Please fix it ASAP. Thanks 
com.ichi2.anki#172594:	  I use it for learning Chinese. I love how easy it is to make your own cards and that the app automatically learns which things you need to review more often and which you don't because you know them well. 
com.ichi2.anki#172601:	   At first it was alright, but now it just stays there saying 'opening collection, please wait' and well no matter how much I wait it doesn't work . 
com.ichi2.anki#172604:	   Andoroid on the nook. Full of bugs when I want a new deck, doesn't search very efficiently and keeps saying the files are wrong when ever I try to download a deck. Very dissapointed. Full of bugs Annoying to use. NOT USER FRIENDLY! 
com.ichi2.anki#172614:	   IF YOUR CARDS ARE BLACK: Go to Preferences > Reviewing and check mark Simple Interface. Awesome learning app, took me a while to get my deck working since it apparently uses HTML but seeing as the problem is solved, this is a super convenient way to learn a new language. 
com.ichi2.anki#172640:	   Freezes or crashes when I'm in the middle of reviewing, and then loses my progress. 
com.ichi2.anki#172642:	  Main advantage: works offlinenMain disadvantage: synchronization often fails and you have to upload/download ALL data again 
com.ichi2.anki#172658:	   My Arabic flashcards are hard to edit. Why isn't there a way of editing them in bulk ? It would save time, because so far the only way to increase font size (the eternal problem with Arabic) is to edit them from my laptop anki 
com.ichi2.anki#172668:	   I have reccommended this app to anyone studying anything I would give 5 stars but the photos I made a deck with on my computer wont display on my phone when synced with anki web. Please fix this! 
com.ichi2.anki#172671:	    in note 2. Please fix it 
com.ichi2.anki#172680:	   Can't sync from a computer 
com.ichi2.anki#172681:	   I'm in med school. The neuroscience block is a ~6 week period where students are pushed to the limit regarding memorization skills. Students are expected to learn well over 1,000 definitions over a 6 week period. I didn't truly realize this hefty requirement until roughly 10 days before the exam, as I was busy with practice questions and conceptual learning (usually the best way to study but NOT for the neuroscience block). I frantically searched for a worthy flashcard app. I had one I was happy with but it just couldn't handle the magnitude of flashcards I needed to make. Long story short, I learned over 1,000 definitions in 10 days with Anki... I should have failed... badly. I made a strong B instead. 1)Free on Google Play ($30 on iTunes) 2)Free desktop app with sync between devices and Mac/PC 3)More options/settings than I will ever need 4)Neuroscience Fact: Your brain has the capacity to store more information than you could memorize in 100 lifetimes (and much more) so download Anki, learn how to use it (~15min) and quickly master any type of information you want. 4a)This is NOT just perfect for language, Anki's learning algorithm is perfect for memorizing. Period. 
com.ichi2.anki#172686:	   Keeps crashing on my HTC incredible 4g 
com.ichi2.anki#172689:	   Could someone please tell me, why do I, more often than not, get an error message "this is not a valid apkg file", upon completion of getting (or at least trying to get) shared decks? Thanks in advance. 
com.ichi2.anki#172705:	   Excellent app. However, I found that text-to-speech wasn't working for me. Something about the right language not being available even though the cards were in English. Also, I don't like the icon. It's not important really, but a new squarer icon would be cool. There should be a quicker way to increase the custom study list for when you want to keep going. A one-touch more button maybe. Still hoping for a study program that can be operated hands-free with voice control. Good work, Anki developers. 
com.ichi2.anki#172709:	   The only problem with it is that it's so awesome and I wish I found it sooner. Then the huge foreign language vocabulary exam would be easier. I am 100% going to use this for the rest of my life. Thank you so much! 
com.ichi2.anki#172710:	   Would appreciate it if there was some way of removing the formatting for the font for the entire deck without having to edit several thousand cards. I created it on AnkiWeb =( for some reason, doesn't sync with my desktop app 
com.ichi2.anki#172715:	   I was impressed with the initial concept of this app but when it came down to the key function of it actually downloading shared apps all I got where error messages telling me the file was invalid. Also the ui is atrocious. 
com.ichi2.anki#172718:	   I know its problem from my side sogiving 4 stars (as yet i dont know much abt app). When i type something, it doesnt search for me, i get blank screen, noting happens. Any help? (I also tried different keywords) Edited: thank u for ur reply and making it free. I downloaded some cards thro pc browser, and it worked. It will be great tp be able to download via this app. But still this app owns 5stars. 
com.ichi2.anki#172727:	   Get "error" when I try to access shared decks. Now get constant network error when trying to log in. Had to uninstall. 
com.ichi2.anki#172731:	   Ankidroid helps me in learning Japanese vocabulary. I would use it if I wanna learn new language or other thing. Thx for fixing the bug. Love this app. 
com.ichi2.anki#172734:	   I've never made flashcards in the past. They didn't work for me and I didn't see the point. By learning how to use this app, my Japanese language skills have improved dramatically. It would be nearly impossible for me to remember more than 300 characters without a program like this. Highly recommended. 
com.ichi2.anki#172740:	   It just doesn't sync with the desktop.. 
com.ichi2.anki#172746:	   I love this app! I am in paramedic class and i have to study medications over thirty of them and it is in the same format class, indication ect. After the first ten or so it won't allow me to continue to write the cards that way i have to write it in a different way like caps or adding an extra letter which is very frustrating if this wad fixed this would be the best flashcard app ever 
com.ichi2.anki#172748:	   I've been using AnkiDroid daily for 6 months learning various topics. The software works great, only crashes when using the phone's Back button at odd times, but the data is safe nonetheless. It's very straightforward to use, and has almost full Anki functionality. Amazing for a free software, thank you guys. 
com.ichi2.anki#172750:	   Crashes literally every time I try and download a shared deck. 
com.ichi2.anki#172752:	   I'm sure this will get fixed soon and I would be happy to give 5 stars as it seems to be a very well polished product 
com.ichi2.anki#172760:	   As a former AnkiMobile user I was a bit cautious to switch to Android because I was not sure how well AnkiDroid would work. AnkiMobile is a paid app and thus support was expected. In case something went wrong with my decks I could always get it fixed by the developer. But it turns out that my fears were ungrounded with AnkiDroid. AnkiDroid has worked flawlessly in the past two months I have used it. Though I have purposefully tried not do anything complicated like adding media or even cards. I have mainly used it for reviewing and always closed the collection by exiting the app with the back button. If used simply for reviewing, filtering, searching and editing there should be no problems at all. I would say that AnkiDroid is on par with AnkiMobile. Maybe even better in some respects :D In short I am very impressed with AnkiDroid. Thank you to all the developers and contributors who spend their time improving it. Also a huge thanks to Damien Elmes. Anki is the number one reason anyone should get a smart phone. 
com.ichi2.anki#172774:	   Update: most problems seem fixed. a few bugs left. Changes on one deck's limits change other decks' limits. ********************************************************************************************* 
com.ichi2.anki#172777:	   It was good before the new version came out. I lost all my cards and can't seem to place it back. Edited: Everything got fixed in the newer version. Works great! Keep backups of course just in case with future upgrades. 
com.ichi2.anki#172778:	   The upgrade lost all of my cards and progress, and I wasn't able to see what was written on the new shared deck I downloaded. Says it will restore things now but it doesn't work. 
com.ichi2.anki#172784:	   This app works quite well and is easy to use. My o only issue is that since the recent upgrade I periodically have to reinstall it because the app will not open. 
com.ichi2.anki#172786:	   If you want a simple app for straight forward out of the box functionality, forget Ankidroid. For someone to have to spend more time learning an app and checking forums and the web for answers, it's better and faster to just waste paper and write it out. I'm sorry but this app maybe intuitive but it's not time effective. Couldn't find any answer as to why all my cards go out of order and once I finished a set, I couldn't find a quick way to just review over again. Used to memorize lines as an actor. Crapapp 
com.ichi2.anki#172794:	   This program was functional, which was good enough for me for a 5 star rating. But now I can't use it because it always tells me "filtering cards. Please wait." I wasted all the time making decks that are useless to me now. Also, it's too hard to sync between phone and desktop versions. Not intuitive at all. 
com.ichi2.anki#172800:	   very nice tool except crashing every time I start it. or it just taking forever to start. just killing the process and start cleanly every time seems to be OK though... 
com.ichi2.anki#172811:	   The new version instead of being I'm upgrade, it looks more like a downgrade. I can't do a custom study session because the selection tags doesn't work correctly. PLEASE fix that soon, I used to love Anki. 
com.ichi2.anki#172814:	   Galaxy II. Continually crashes now and is unusable, which is sad, because 1.0 worked AMAZING and never crashed once. I can get by on the browser and desktop, but ankidroid was great while it worked. 
com.ichi2.anki#172817:	   The import of decks fails half the time, when it is successful the cards goes to the wrong deck... too many bugs to be usable 
com.ichi2.anki#172828:	   An almost pitch-perfect clone of the awesome Anki 2.0 desktop version. However, there's a problem with the .apkg decks showing up when I'm using my PC to browse the AnkiDroid file in my phone. I can review my decks fine, but when I want to export them to my desktop, I can't find the file at all; all I see are dated files from before the 2.0 update. Still, it's a great app for any serious SRS user. 
com.ichi2.anki#172835:	   This app is only good for premade decks, and it's not really user friendly. It took me an hour to find out that just pushing the "synchronize" button won't get you synchronized with your desktop - you have to go to download> personal deck to manually download your decks. Not very intuitive, needs tutorials. And no picture input or voice record only text input. I'd give anything for a full-featured Anki app compatible with my Note's S-pen! 
com.ichi2.anki#172836:	   Now shared decks get an error and disappear each time you sync. Why does every upgrade make this app worse? 
com.ichi2.anki#172838:	   ankiweb on my galaxy s 2 is awesome. But on my nexus 7 I a always get 'network error' when trying to log in, sync, or sign up :'( 
com.ichi2.anki#172846:	   I love Anki. I started using it three years ago - it was sophisticated, yet simple and very powerful. In the application world there are three categories: Free, Well-Supported, Well-Developed. The magical unicorn applications are all three and are VERY few and far between. Anki is one of them. Hands down. Anki is incredible! (All the complaints seem to be from people who have issues with (1) their devices or (2) didn't read the upgrade instructions when upgrading from Anki 1 to the new, shiny Anki 2 fyi. Neophytes won't have any issues with Anki). 
com.ichi2.anki#172852:	   As above. Great program, looks great now. Ppl need to stop complaining about a free app that is not working due to their incompetence 
com.ichi2.anki#172861:	   Many error when try download shared decks 
com.ichi2.anki#172870:	   Works well. Great developer support. This is the best flash card system I've found. It's support for LaTeX is also a big plus that you won't find in other flash card systems. 
com.ichi2.anki#172872:	   Right now this app is the most used app on my phone and my tablet. I have a board exam and tons of study information to memorize, anki has helped me so much. P.s. There's lag switching to next cards on tablet. Can you fix that? 
com.ichi2.anki#172878:	   Help me a lot for learning German words. The only problem is that sync is not automatically done like in the desktop version. 
com.ichi2.anki#172887:	   The app takes way too long to load I'm waiting nearly 5 mins and it still won't even open. Please fix this because it is a great app otherwise 
com.ichi2.anki#172888:	   Especially good for learning languages! You'll find many premade decks with flashcards to build up your language or learn from scratch...(Spanish, German, French, you name it!) Very nice User Interface too with graphs. Nice how it works and repeats the words every now and then so you don't forget (the more you hit you guessed the word, the longer the time till it shows it again for you to recall it. I know what app to use on the bus on when I want to kill time and "grow neurons" :P I use it every day since a week or so, I love it! Sync`s pretty well too, sometimes it fails but you try later and it always works. 5 Stars! 
com.ichi2.anki#172893:	   I really want this app to work, because no other ones let you rate how well you know a term. However, they really need to find a better way to sync things. The server is "too busy" too often, and when you do get to sync, it takes too long. Not to mention that the switching over to the new version is overly complicated. I went to a different flash card app. But fix these things an I'll come back. 
com.ichi2.anki#172895:	   The app has a good interface, it has a clean look that does not hamper studying. But anytime i try to sync my device, it always say " The time of your device is different than that of the server by 1816 sec; unable to sync." Is there something that I should do? It was my first time using this app. Overall, I agree to most users that it really helps in studying. Please help with the sync error! 
com.ichi2.anki#172898:	   Anki has become an indispensable learning tool in preparing for my exams as a medical student. wherever my phone goes, ALL my flashcards go, to. The recently updated interface is much cleaner and easier to navigate. For users who are worried about upgrading & migrating their decks to the new version, I followed the simple instructions in the link provided in the description above, and all of my decks transferred without a problem. 
com.ichi2.anki#172899:	   It was a great app, but after updating to the new version I lost all data and cannot sync with server because of time zone difference 
com.ichi2.anki#172904:	  Love this app, but I get errors every time I try and download to my phone. HTC Incredible 
com.ichi2.anki#172905:	   This cross platform system works without any problems allowing my to type up notes with my laptop & to bring them anywhere with me in my pocket. Anki also manages how much you have to review per card while you focus on reviewing. 
com.ichi2.anki#172912:	   Update problems have been ongoing, as others have noted. Decks suddenly become unavailable. Ridiculous. 
com.ichi2.anki#172917:	   I have it installed on my nexus 7 and nexus 4. The Anki desktop version is a must for doing the initial hard work. The adopts themselves work fine but a bit limited compared to the desktop version, and a bit buggy at times. The interface is not the most user friendly and has a step learning curve trying to find everything. However it is the most useful app on my devices and enjoying memorising new languages. I hope the sync bugs will be resolved soon and the user interface improves. 
com.ichi2.anki#172920:	   I cannot find one way to create cards my computer. I went with a program that I could create cards easily in a Web based format instead of on my phone. 
com.ichi2.anki#172921:	   I generally expect huge warning signs before an update eats two hours if my life. I am busy. Don't have the time. Don't use these decks on my pc. I hope this software crashes and burns and is replaced by someone who puts in a little forethought towards their users. 
com.ichi2.anki#172922:	   Scheduling isn't by time like one would expect. It says 3 hours sure. But really it just puts it at the back of the review deck and if - for example - there were only 2 cards, you would see the card in 2 seconds. Also, if you have a TON of cards anki bugs out and forgets to schedule your review cards and you don't see the bugged reviews until you are done studying, completely causing you to forget those cards. 
com.ichi2.anki#172925:	   I haven't downloaded the latest version yet, but the app is awesome. This was exactly what I was looking for. Rarely do I come across an app, which does everything that is required. Thumbs Up from me 
com.ichi2.anki#172926:	   This app was great initially but I think after the update isn't as impressive. Even though I changed the settings to randomize my cards, it still quizzes me in the order I inputted them. Also I have to keep changing the whiteboard settings before I start reviewing each time now. Yeah I lost my decks too, but that's not my complaint. Error messages show each time i open the app too. Please fix these issues :( I downloaded another flashcard app to replace this one. 
com.ichi2.anki#172928:	   Anki used to work much better before the upgrade to 2.0. Migration of old decks to 2.0 was easy just following directions. However, in the previous version I could easily review only marked cards, that option seems to be gone or is hidden behind too many steps but I cannot find a way. Sync is also broken, now my tablet states the time of my device is "3619 seconds different than that of the server." It's easier to shop for a new app than to spend hours wading through old, outdated irrelevant forum posts to try and fix what used to work perfectly fine. 
com.ichi2.anki#172930:	   Updated to 2.0 and the program crashes before it runs! Horrible! 
com.ichi2.anki#172939:	   The newly designed interface is gorgeous, and there are less bugs compared to before. BUT the settings have become much more complicated and confusing, making it more difficult to use my flashcards effectively. 
com.ichi2.anki#172940:	   First it refused to migrate any decks from the old cloud, which could be worked around by processing the decks in the desktop Anki2. Then it totally failed to sync a brand new deck from Ankiweb, and even deleted all my cards from there for good measure. I was able to recover the card text from the notes table in the phone db at least. Not sure how this can all be so broken? 
com.ichi2.anki#172956:	   Finally, after months of waiting, I don't need to be stuck with my computer to memorized those words. Even though the media is not working, it's still a promising app. Keep up the good work!! 
com.ichi2.anki#172961:	   Since the newest update, I lost all of the cards that I spent hours inputting! The import won't work because all of my old cards are no longer compatible! 
com.ichi2.anki#172965:	   Love the app, it gave a nice boost to my progress of learning german. Unfortunately the night mode doen't work since replaced latest 2.0 beta updated with stable 2.0 update offered by google play. 
com.ichi2.anki#172984:	   Liked it on comp, makes sense on phone, but couldn't load decks 
com.ichi2.anki#172993:	   Has great potential but could not get any of it on my Samsung galaxy nexus. Couldn't create deck or edit when it was going wrong. Would not let me create an account online from my phone and kept freezing up. If it works correctly I would install again but not it is =( 
com.ichi2.anki#173001:	   It says "can't access the sd card". All other apps seem to happy with the sd card... 
com.ichi2.anki#173017:	   If your device does not have sd external storage you can't use this version. The beta on their site works fine though. The sync feature and card library are very useful. 
com.ichi2.anki#173021:	   At the beginning, i think it was a great and free app, but the app has always some bugs and i lost 2000 flash card 2 times, Very bad!!! 
com.ichi2.anki#173028:	   Occasionally an error but every app does, the best flashcard program I've ever used. The sync from my computer to phone makes it easy to make and use the cards.. totally recommend it! 
com.ichi2.anki#173034:	   Good for the desktop, but sucks for the droid. It has major syncing problems. 
com.ichi2.anki#173037:	   It used to be irreplaceable and i used it every day. About half a year ago, the UI update messed up widgets and calculation of cards for me. Now for about two months i haven't been able to review any cards - the app crashes EVERY TIME. I sent many error reports and they always come back with "known issue, pending investigation". Well, why don't you investigate a little FASTER, please, because this is quite a serious issue to have. The UI is also buggy - the "help" button is just a black square for me for example and the usability in general is hit-and-miss. I've been experiencing these and other issues for way too long with the developer seeminbgly paying zero attention to them and I think it's time to find an alternative. SGS3 
com.ichi2.anki#173038:	   Thanks! But last few times in didn' work correct ( Didn't syncgronize. It's closed with lots of mistakes. 
com.ichi2.anki#173041:	   I was studying my 130 flash cards that i made the night before a test and the app crashed and deleted my deck and the back up deck is corrupted. No one should get this app it is the worst i have ever seen 
com.ichi2.anki#173049:	   I really love the first version of Anki and I've been using it nonstop to teach myself swahili by using pictures, sound files and just direct word to word translations, and my daughter has been using it to study for her anatomy tests. I whip out my phone in long grocery store lines and study a quick 10 cards here or there. I love the functionality, the ease of use and the tracking system. I made the mistake of downloading Anki 2 because they disabled the deck sharing for the original version. I should have left well enough alone! Anki 2 is like a house in the process of being built: it's got a foundation and some exposed studs and beams, but no working bathroom, kitchen or electricity. Essentially it's a shell of its former self. Unusable. Well, says I, I'll just revert back to Anki 1 and wait until they have a full working version. So I reverted (all my painstakingly constructed decks are backed up) but it will no longer let me add cards, make revisions or sync. It no longer recognizes my log in creds. Continuing the house analogy, it's like I came back to my old home to find the locks changed. Very sad, Anki. Very sad. 
com.ichi2.anki#173051:	   It took a while to get them working on my computer but how the heck do I solve this issue on my phone 
com.ichi2.anki#173056:	   shows error "can't find sd card" after start. 
com.ichi2.anki#173059:	   Doesn't sync anything at all. 
com.ichi2.anki#173062:	   Found this through trying to learn jap. I even make my own deck to deepen my Chinese and English. But there is a problem with my HTC one V now, error report keep appearing after screen locks. 
com.ichi2.anki#173064:	   It works great. I don't have an issue with this at all 
com.ichi2.anki#173065:	   Almost perfect and new beta version is beautiful. However enabling TTS for a single side and being able to set a default language without needing to reselect on each card would be great. Additionally a list review showing both questions and answers needs to be added. Other than these issues, its great. 
com.ichi2.anki#173067:	   This usually works very well. However recently I have had issues with it syncing and updating on both my computer and anki mobile. Otherwise, it has been great. I really appreciate all of the hard work they put into it, and for free! The ios version is much more expensive, so I am glad to have such giving people work on an Android version. Thanks again! 
com.ichi2.anki#173070:	  Great but i could not get sound to work 
com.ichi2.anki#173074:	   I've tried multiple times to use it on my 700T and every time I get the same problem... It fails on the first card in any deck. And after submitting the problem I always get the same "known problem" response. 
com.ichi2.anki#173076:	   I love anki, but the apps simply crashes every time I open a deck. This is on a galaxy note with ice cream sandwich. 
com.ichi2.anki#173077:	   Used to work great, recently has been crashing when opening any deck. SGS3 
com.ichi2.anki#173085:	   It keeps crashing. Please fix it. 
com.ichi2.anki#173091:	  I'll say this. This use to work perfectly. I haven't used it in a while but once I did, every time I try to download a new deck it crashes. HTC EVO 
com.ichi2.anki#173097:	   the only issue with 1.2beta17 I have it is not able to use two SVOX tts voices for front and back respectively. When app first assigns languages to card sides it does not list Russian svox voice(which is installed and working fine). 
com.ichi2.anki#173107:	   I love Anki. It isn't the most intuitive when you first start, but this is an app that I used for almost 1 hour every day. Who cares that it was a little difficult at first. The best part of the app is syncing online between my phone and computers, but you have to remember to sync or you could find yourself repeating. Could give up sliced bread but not Anki - even with issues it is an easy 5 
com.ichi2.anki#173110:	   I wanted a flashcard app that uses multiple sides, easy import from quizzlet and flashcardexchange, and would allow me to freely write on a card to test my knowledge instead of just thinking the answer. I didn't get multiple sides, but I got most everything else I wanted. Having the program on my desktop boosts the rating. Takes a little while to get use to it, but the more I use it, the more I like it. 
com.ichi2.anki#173112:	   On startup complains that internal storage is missing, and after that crashes every time a review is started. 
com.ichi2.anki#173115:	   A few bugs but great way to organize, diseases and drugs for medical school 
com.ichi2.anki#173121:	   I cannot use this app on my galaxy nexus because it tells me that there is no SD card. This is true but there is an SD partition. If support is added I will change this rating 
com.ichi2.anki#173122:	   Spent all day writing flashcards, and they won't sync. Received no help when I reported the bug, and I still remain gridlocked with decks that won't sync to my Galaxy nexus. Don't waste your time, wait for the devs to get their acts together, which I hope they do- soon. 
com.ichi2.anki#173124:	   Wouldnt even let me move on to the next question! Gave me an error message every time! 
com.ichi2.anki#173128:	   1. No Goggle Docs import. 2. Don't like being herded and forced to use online site. 3. No immediate re-test and review of wrong answers in Cram. 4. It's "algorithm" based learning theory doesn't work well for large quantities of data. Like a language deck of 5,000 cards. Because wrong answers come back up randomly, versus assessing and reviewing all wrong answers together, and retesting them together as an option. If you need to do an assessment exam, that simulates the real quiz, Anki isn't the best. 
com.ichi2.anki#173130:	   I was able to make jumpmaster school flash cards and share them with otherstudents after they downloaded the app. Had some issues uploading the file to the ankidroid database, but I emailed the file to all my fellow students and that worked too. 
com.ichi2.anki#173134:	   ...feature? Don't like deleting a card to correct a small error. 
com.ichi2.anki#173141:	   Can't get it to sync with my online account/laptop. 
com.ichi2.anki#173158:	   I used this app for some time now and I can say that it helps a lot with my studying. Nevertheless, there some bugs that should be fixed: 1. When modifying decks on server and phone the same time, I get a message which indicates a conflict and let me choose which one to keep. Now what if I wanna keep both? I think merging should be that difficult to implement and it's aboat time to have it. I downloaded this app months ago... 2. Sometimes I get cards that show me insane time periods, like one month, 2 month 
com.ichi2.anki#173165:	   Love this app, but I wish there was a way to change the failed card handling here instead of having to do it on the computer. Plus the new update won't let me download my personal decks 
com.ichi2.anki#173166:	   Beta has new bugs 
com.ichi2.anki#173174:	   A few syncing bugs now and then but this is a great service for language learning. 
com.ichi2.anki#173178:	   There's something wrong when i sync my media data. All data are uploaded by dropbox, but anki only downloaded few cards then appear an error alert. Pls fix it. Thanks 
com.ichi2.anki#173181:	   If you need to memorize a large amount of info, look no more. Spaced Repetition System shows more often failed cards and less often those you remember the better, this way you'll optimize your learning time. Widely used for language learning. Plenty of pre-made decks for all kind of subjects or you can make you own. 
com.ichi2.anki#173186:	   I had given the app a poor rating when the pictures were failing to show up so it's only fair that I re-rate the app accordingly now that this is rectified. Great service for memorization. 
com.ichi2.anki#173187:	   Upgrade to 5 stars after that nasty synch bug was fixed. Incredibly useful, thank you so much for this! 
com.ichi2.anki#173190:	   There is a really annoying notification that you can't remove when using this app. Other than that its great. 
com.ichi2.anki#173198:	   Little to no help in fixing the issue. 
com.ichi2.anki#173202:	   Really great app. Never had a problem with it and I use it nearly every day 
com.ichi2.anki#173212:	  Awesome! Don't forget to donate if you like this!! 
com.ichi2.anki#173216:	   Thx for working hard to fix the last version - it kept crashing evry time i tried to download my decks. Am so happy to be able to use my flashcards on my phone again - appreciate yr time & effort in supporting ths awesome app! 
com.ichi2.anki#173217:	   I like this app, but this update keeps showing up that says 'only update if you are having specific problems' I'm not, and some people say the update causes crashes. This should be fixed. 
com.ichi2.anki#173220:	   Love the app but there is this error that prevents me from downloading shared decks 
com.ichi2.anki#173225:	   Works fantastic, unfortunately audio doesn't work. 
com.ichi2.anki#173226:	   The app is perfect, using it daily. However, the last update comes with a performance issue: showing the answer of a question takes pretty long now (was instantly). Please fix it! 
com.ichi2.anki#173231:	   They got to the bottom of the problem I had very quickly and addressed it! Now the app works perfectly 
com.ichi2.anki#173236:	   very good app and useful, sometimes crashes on sync though if the deck is empty. Also very good that it is supported on all major operating systems. 
com.ichi2.anki#173240:	   Bug was fixed. Best Flashcard app out there. 
com.ichi2.anki#173246:	   Sorry about previous reviews, first was Ankidroid's fault but they fixed it, second was me having bad settings in my dropbox. Very useful tool for being able to learn things on the go. 
com.ichi2.anki#173248:	   Worked perfectly until the latest update. Syncing doesn't work and attempting to download a deck causes the app to crash. Please fix this so that I can update this review to the five stars I think it should have. 
com.ichi2.anki#173251:	   Wow I had just mentioned the other of the problems with the last backup after having just created an account online and now it's fixed... Devs are quick THANK YOU SO MUCH for such a wonderfully useful app ^_^ 
com.ichi2.anki#173252:	   Tthanks for the fixes, now it works great. One of the best app. Use it a lot! 
com.ichi2.anki#173254:	   The best flashcard app. I've been using it to study Thai. However, I can't get sounds or images to work on Android. 
com.ichi2.anki#173258:	   Love this app but it was crashing. Update fixed it. Thanks! 
com.ichi2.anki#173259:	   Update fixed everything, love it, works like a dream! 
com.ichi2.anki#173261:	   Latest update seems to have fixed my force close issues... now lets see how well it works :-) 
com.ichi2.anki#173262:	   Latest update fix crashing! 5* 
com.ichi2.anki#173265:	   Please fix this crush when you try downloading personal deck... 
com.ichi2.anki#173266:	   Please update... an error occuring when i try to download shared decks 
com.ichi2.anki#173267:	   This app is great for studying, but is totally useless since the last update...taking too long to fix! 
com.ichi2.anki#173269:	   Seems the shared deck feature isn't working. :-( 
com.ichi2.anki#173271:	    crash crash 
com.ichi2.anki#173272:	   Different than the one I had before. Can not use at all 
com.ichi2.anki#173273:	   A good app overall, but why does the app auto close whenever i sync a deck with new cards containing images/media? I then have to reopen the app and download missing media. Crashes when trying to download a new deck. Having the same 1.1.1 problems as other users 
com.ichi2.anki#173274:	   I was looking forward to using Anki for the first time, but am extremely disappointed that it crashes when I attempt to create a deck, and won't connect to Shared Decks for me to download. Hope they get it running soon with an update, because until then it's useless. 
com.ichi2.anki#173275:	   Program gives network error when trying to download decks. And it crashes on s2 
com.ichi2.anki#173276:	   Getting decks to sync correctly takes a monk's like patience. If I hadn't used it a long time ago and seen the many good reviews, I would have just assumed that the program just does not work. I have not been able to download personal or shared decks for weeks, which has really set back my language learning goals. I understand that the program is developed by one person. I really appreciate his hard work. I think, perhaps, he should seek outside help to quickly fix errors when they occur. 
com.ichi2.anki#173277:	   New patch broke it! Hope its fixed soon 
com.ichi2.anki#173278:	   App has a lot of features, that so-so work. Unfortunately for the last week or so, havent been able to load decks. Nice feature about the app is that there is a desktop client to do data entry. I have finals and wish I would have known that I wouldn't be able to transfer the decks to my mobile before I spetnt so much time entering the data. I have submitted NUMEROUS bugs, and each time it states its a known issue. Bad timing before the end of the term. will rate higher if this gets fixed, but the app is useless if you can't load decks 
com.ichi2.anki#173281:	   Can't download any decks as a new user 
com.ichi2.anki#173282:	   Love the app, but until the last patch that broke it gets fixed, it's getting a 1/5 from me. Can't make or download new decks because of force closing. Shouldn't this have been fixed by now? 
com.ichi2.anki#173284:	   This is a fantastic app but they must fix downloading the shared decks issue 
com.ichi2.anki#173285:	   Toshiba Thrive users should stick with ver. 1.1. Version 1.1.1 crashes on deck downloads and editing. 
com.ichi2.anki#173286:	   I haved loved using this program until recently, now can't download any decks and it is really frustrating. 
com.ichi2.anki#173288:	   It comes with a tutorial deck that I did not plan to study. But when I try download my personal decks, my phone immediately vibrates then crashes... every time. Doesn't appear to work with samsung galaxy yet. 
com.ichi2.anki#173290:	  App keeps crashing after the update. 
com.ichi2.anki#173291:	   So many bugs in my Samsung Galaxy S x(. Lost all my decks (and study progression >.<), and now it crashes every time I try to give a name to a new deck... Its a shame x( 
com.ichi2.anki#173292:	   Always force closes on my HTC Desire S. Always crashing. Awful. 
com.ichi2.anki#173293:	   Anki is absolutely great. Just skip the 1.1.1 upgrade, otherwise it will crash when downloading decks. If needed, you can downgrade using the 1.1 version from their website. 
com.ichi2.anki#173294:	   Can't do anything with this app outside of the tutorial. All it does is crash. 
com.ichi2.anki#173295:	   I love this app! Simple and useful. Still a few minor bugs tho... 
com.ichi2.anki#173296:	   I just installed the app, however, I'm not able to download any decks, the program gets crashed. Otherwise, seems to be a good one. 
com.ichi2.anki#173298:	   Used to love it, but keep gettin insufficient storage errors on the update (despite 500 mb free on phone and 1 GB free on flash) 
com.ichi2.anki#173299:	   The counting time was reset when I change from vertical view to horizontal view, or from horizontal view to vertical view. Please fix it. 
com.ichi2.anki#173300:	   I love the program also. With the older version I downloaded a shared deck and was enjoying studying. I was however having problems getting images to appear for cards that I created and at a last resort I decided to upgrade, though it mentioned nothing of fixing my problem, but I figured I would still download it just in case. BAD idea............ I can't download personal decks as I get a force close error and I also can't download shared decks either. I hope a fix is issued immediately. 
com.ichi2.anki#173301:	   It crashes when adding personal deck. It's useless for that! 
com.ichi2.anki#173303:	   Can't download shared decks. Nexus one 2.3 
com.ichi2.anki#173305:	   But now can't get personal decks 
com.ichi2.anki#173307:	   There is a problem with the new update, there is coding error in java that is causing it to crash when you try to download a deck and mades public decks inaccessible. Love the program, shouldn't have updated... 
com.ichi2.anki#173308:	   Whenever I try to either create or download a deck, the app crashes. 
com.ichi2.anki#173309:	   They really want you to upload your deck. Everytime I even tried to create my own, they system stopped on me. I don't care for reporting the problem, I don't want one to happen from the beggining. 
com.ichi2.anki#173313:	   This is a terrific tool for studying, and I eagerly await the next version. The interface is often clunky, with sections and features tucked away in unintuitive places. I also have been experiencing full-on crashes nearly every time I try to browse shared decks. Thank you for this product; keep improving it, and I'll keep using it! 
com.ichi2.anki#173321:	   Great idea! Hope to improvr my chinese by using this app. 5 stars if the force close problem fixed. 
com.ichi2.anki#173323:	   Thought I had found a good App That lets me make my own flashcards. Was prompted to have an account so it can sync to my App however it will not sync. What is the point? 
com.ichi2.anki#173328:	   Works great on my Xoom. Always has. oh, wait... they added a feature I don't use? Better change my rating to a one. Force closes? Must be the app. Couldnt be all that porn I downloaded. Zero. Some of the logic people use to rate apps defies explanation. 
com.ichi2.anki#173332:	   Downloaded 1 deck and crashed / force closed on Galaxy Android. Trying on PC but disappointed with results on phone 
com.ichi2.anki#173333:	   Really has never failed me after3 years of use 
com.ichi2.anki#173335:	   I don't get it. The droid interface is not bad, but the desktop application and AnkiWeb are extremely cumbersome. Looking for a flashcard reader I can share among platforms and users was a HUGE time waster! The AnkiWeb is awful, how do you change deck names? The desktop app is awful, I want to import and it has to be in UTF-8 from a CSV. Why? And, then I exported and the darn export file is LOCKED? What's up w/ that? Also, the cards available from the 'community' for I wanted was limited to none! I found more on anymemo or another one. But, I don't like those either, I digress. I would say that I do like the interface and the algorithm that Ankidroid uses on my droid phone. there was one other flashcard program where you could only go through the cards sequentially and you had to slide them. I'll get carpal tunnel from all the sliding, so Anki is better there. In all, I don't get the 4.5 average stars, maybe 2. the time invested and lack of intuitive feel is excruciating. Steve Jobs would fire you... 
com.ichi2.anki#173337:	   Doesn't work on ICS. Needs update! 
com.ichi2.anki#173341:	   Samsung Captivate CM9-4-19-2012 After selecting each time of next occurrence it crashes and loads an error reporting screen. After submitting an error report it states the error is known. The windows app is awesome though. 
com.ichi2.anki#173343:	   crashes a lot, can't view images on flash cards, this might be a nexus issue due to it having a virtual sdcard, sometimes get an error saying can't read from sdcard or images are just blank...will give five once issues resolved 
com.ichi2.anki#173348:	   I did not download this to learn about capitals. It seems like you are stuck on getting cards from them. It doesnt give a clean indicator of how to create your own set of flash cards. They use git as their repository. That is about the, most unintuitive application there is.... says something about the developers. 
com.ichi2.anki#173350:	   Anki has actually revolutionized my study habits. Seriously. When studying, I come up with a long list of questions using Anki desktop, sync with Anki online and then review on my phone whenever I have a chance so there is no excuse to never study because my phone is always with me. Thank you Anki for helping my grades! 
com.ichi2.anki#173353:	   Cool app, but it has bugs. A error window often occurs. 
com.ichi2.anki#173358:	  Excellent. I use this every day on a Asus Transformer TF201 tablet, works great with spoken French & English translation. Odd times the 1st card fails with the text to speech, but then it seems to work fine. 
com.ichi2.anki#173360:	   After creating my deck I reviewed about 4 cards and it started coming up with errors and saying my deck was corrupted. Tried again and my deck was gone. Seems like it would be awesome if it worked. 
com.ichi2.anki#173362:	   Repeatedly crashes when I try to add a card. Nexus 
com.ichi2.anki#173364:	   I got the most recent update a few weeks ago. For one of my decks I allowed the # of cards due to grow a bit. I've done this before without issue so I finally decided to review my deck today. In the middle of reviewing, my deck got corrupted. Repairing the deck failed so I dl'ed again from the server. Now Anki stays stuck on the same card unless I choose "Show Again" -- had Anki for 18+ mo. and AnkiDroid for 6+ mo. This problem is a first for me, but disconcerting nonetheless. DROIDX. 
com.ichi2.anki#173373:	   But I can't get the widget??? It doesn't show. Been waiting for the widget to work again. Moto d2g 
com.ichi2.anki#173380:	  Syncing is there but doesn't work properly, its on the way to being great, but not yet 
com.ichi2.anki#173383:	   Since last update the Android light and dark themes look strange. In the loading popular text is white on white so it's not readable, and similar issues. Please fix. 
com.ichi2.anki#173407:	   I've been using Anki for over two years now and have become progressively more impressed with it as it's matured. Only problem I ever had with FCs ended up being a problem with my SD card being corrupted, and I've used it on Froyo, Gingerbread, and ICS devices. It's currently running flawlessly on my Galaxy Nexus. I love the fact that there are so many options for customizing cards/reviews, although finding all the relevant features can be overwhelming after a major upgrade since things are sometimes relocated to totally new locations in the interface. One gripe is that syncing is manual. I'd really appreciate an auto-sync feature that would update the cloud copy on completing a session or exiting the app. But what's really great is the Japanese plugin in the associated desktop application that autogenerates the furigana readings for kanji flashcards. It makes creation of japanese vocabulary cards extremely fast and simple on a WinPC. ...in fact, that's my only remaining criticism of AnkiDroid...being that I've started using an Android tab as a laptop replacement, I'd really love seeing a similar feature available for the card creator in AnkiDroid. 
com.ichi2.anki#173408:	   I had this when I had gingerbread and loved it. Never had a single problem. One of the main reasons I chose another android was for this program but the ICS version is REALLY buggy. -It crashes daily. -For whatever reason, about 75% of the time the settings button does not show up when I'm doing reviews so I can't edit cards as I go. -Unlike the GB version, this one did not prompt me to choose "sync from local" and I lost 100 flashcards during a sync. -Backups don't work right and I can't find a way to actually restore from backup. I had to make a whole new deck and load it from my computer, sync from computer, then sync the new deck onto my droid... -I'm getting some kind of database error now from the ankidroid PC program. -When browsing card lists, the sort option does not work (when sorting by date) Despite all this I would say it's still the best flashcard program out there. If you're not on ICS I highly recommend it. If you ARE on ICS then I still recommend it but be careful and expect to get a little frustrated but the good is worth the bad. When I get an update that fixes some of these problems I will edit my review back up to a 5. 
com.ichi2.anki#173414:	   Great program unfortunately most of the decks I have contain audio ,which doesn't get played I'm on Nexus S ICS 4.0.3 
com.ichi2.anki#173417:	   Unfortunately crashes quite often on launch on my system. Once it runs, there are no problems what so ever. 
com.ichi2.anki#173418:	   Some bugs. 1) Does not show pictures. I tried the same deck as on the screenshot - does not work. 2) Cancelling deck download hangs forever, need to restart the phone. 
com.ichi2.anki#173420:	   Promising but still a few bugs to work out. 
com.ichi2.anki#173421:	   Had to re install to fix widgets. Disappointed by lack of response but still a great app! 
com.ichi2.anki#173423:	   But has a few annoying bugs 
com.ichi2.anki#173434:	   Used to work great, but now I cannot load any of my decks! Also some cards in certain decks do not display at all. 
com.ichi2.anki#173439:	   Oh no! I updated, but I faced several issues with the new release: card browser isn't updated after adding and anki stayes in memory after exit. 
com.ichi2.anki#173459:	   it gives a error for latex flashcards 
com.ichi2.anki#173466:	  Anki corrupted a deck of 33 cards which I cannot use anymore. 
com.ichi2.anki#173477:	   Nice when you can actually sync without errors 
com.ichi2.anki#173493:	  A really great app! I practice my Japanese vocabulary with it and I've never had any problem. 
com.ichi2.anki#173520:	  Would be a better app if it had a deck makeing option, if it does already I cannot find it 
com.ichi2.anki#173537:	  Once installed it forced japanese symbols into my maps program & crashed my phone & tried to force audio into japanese as well. UNINTALLED 
com.ichi2.anki#173548:	  I have some sync problems in my SGS, but the app works great. I use it a lot. 
com.ichi2.anki#173550:	  please fix the frequent crashes. Other than that I love it 
com.ichi2.anki#173553:	  A must have to learn Chinese characters ( and lot of other stuff I don't use) 
com.ichi2.anki#173560:	  Great app! Updated version has many new features. Night mode is a great idea but seems to have some problems with displaying all of the answer. 
com.ichi2.anki#173563:	   I have tried several SRS systems and this one is by far the best. No problem at all with syncing. There is a small issues with left-to-right characters (arab, hebrew), that will only be written left-to-right. Am using it together with the Desktop client. 
com.ichi2.anki#173564:	   What are you people talking about? Sync works well in the latest version. This does exactly what I need it to, and I haven't run into any problems yet. Thanks for fixing the crash bugs and sync flakiness of the last version. 
com.ichi2.anki#173568:	  Experiencing serious lag issues and FCs now that I have in excess of 24,000 cards. Pls further optimize performance. 
com.ichi2.anki#173572:	  Love the app, but can't find an option to reverse a deck, i.e. if I have a Chinese to English deck, why can't I flip it and review En to Cn? 
com.ichi2.anki#173597:	  Its not working on my samsung moment. 
com.ichi2.anki#173598:	  Synching would be great. Also the review early button doesn't work, and it tells me to come back tomorrow 
com.ichi2.anki#173599:	  PLEASE add search feature to the decks. Downloading and in the library.I can deal with no syncing as long as I can find decks..Add syncing too, please 
com.ichi2.anki#173605:	  Crashes on HTC hero after JED export... had high hopes. 
com.ichi2.anki#173610:	  Doesn't work at all. Droid x 2.2 
com.ichi2.anki#173617:	  Great development! Would like search feature for shared decks and fixed review option. 
com.ichi2.anki#173619:	  The project is Great. But won't let me continue using it until next day! It should let me use it as much as I want! (Fixed after upgrade!, thks!) 
com.ichi2.anki#173622:	  Last update was a huge improvement. Downloading decks on the fly and forced close problems fixed. Really helpful app! 
com.ichi2.anki#173625:	  New version has black text on black background. Epic fail. My phone is G1. 
com.ichi2.anki#173629:	  Useless if I can't download decks directly to it. 
com.ichi2.anki#173633:	  With no web sync I can't use it. 
com.ichi2.anki#173637:	  Sometimes crashes for no reason on the Evo. Good though. 
com.ichi2.anki#173641:	  How can I review early? It doesn't work when I click review early. 
com.ichi2.anki#173664:	  Not working at all!
