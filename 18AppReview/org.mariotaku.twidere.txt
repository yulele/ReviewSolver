org.mariotaku.twidere#10002:	  Quotes have exploded in my interactions tab overnight for no reason, and I clearly remember my settings as mentions only. It now says 'only available with official keys'. Is this an issue on twitter's side, because a desktop app that I use had the same exact issue. I had to filter everything but my username to get it to work. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10005:	  Love love love this app! It is hands-down the best free twitter client. Sometimes an update will screw things up but the developer usually does a really good job of fixing it ASAP and s/he is always super responsive and helpful whenever I send support emails about bugs or suggestions. I can't recommend twidere enough. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10006:	  I don't know what's been done to this, but it's virtually unusable now. The timeline takes forever to load, mentions are even worse, and I don't get notified about DMs at all. And it cannot handle a network change. Times out and has to be restarted, and even that doesn't always work. I've tried resetting it and reinstalling it, and it just gets worse. None of my other apps are doing this. What's going on? Edit - thank you for replying. It loads much better now, but it's gone back to not loading all replies in a thread, even though I've entered the same key as I was using before, from your github page, and my most recent mentions are missing. Any ideas? Edit - no, that had made no difference. Also, since I reinstalled it, it doesn't tell me how many replies a tweet has had, it doesn't notify me when someone likes or retweets me, and I no longer see the translate option. And polls don't work any more. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10007:	  It's a nice app, clean and fast. But we cannot send photos via DM anymore? The notification for DMs also never show up, and I can't view my group DMs. Hope you could fix this soon. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10009:	  ++++ Minimalist and lightweight +++ Complete and versatile features for twitter users --- no background notifications -- crashes at times 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10010:	  Loads much faster than the original twitter app, looks great but unfortunately it didn't give me any notifications... Uninstalling for that reason. If it gets fixed I would be happy to redownload! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10011:	  Now takes much longer to load and crashes often. Hideous square icon still present. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10013:	  Really a great app. Only one issue is that the reply's won't load 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10020:	  Great again! Fixed several issues. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10022:	  I know it's made for phones, but it's the best looking twitter client I tried on my tablet so far. Or was - - after last update, it now shows two columns, each one cramped on half the screen. I liked it better when each column occupied the whole screen - - it was less confusing, much easier to read. Maybe have an option to revert it back to how it was, and it would be a five star app again. Edit: changing the review to 5 stars since last update solved the issue. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10028:	  Twidere has many +points: Free, AD-free, uses Encrypted TLS/SSL, etc. So it can be best, if it is further improved. Inside Settings, an option is necessary to keep AnyType Location-Access disabled, in that way, it wont by mistake access+add such data. It should not access "identity". Pls add an option to retwit a twit/rt without goin thru "cancel-retweet" step, as that removes the twit from list, & findin agn is tuff :( Thanks. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10030:	  Used to love this app. Such a great Twitter client but not getting notifications and now snappytv support is gone which sucks. Please fix! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10033:	  It's a really good and smooth third-party app! The only thing is that the search function doesn't work and says something about a wrong url 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10035:	  Force closed after the last update. Please fix this :( (Samsung Galaxy 3) 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10038:	  Played with it for a month, and it seemed okay. Now, for some reason, it's gone into a two column mode, with everything scrunched into the left half of the screen, with an empty right column that just says "swipe to refresh". Swiping doesn't refresh it, and I can't find any setting anywhere that explains this second dead column. If I can't remove it, I'm going to uninstall. Half a screen is only half a client. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10041:	  This app fast and speed but list adding makes errors. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10050:	   Frequently error when trying to open media. The media won't load!!! Please fix 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10053:	   When I open the app they come up. I have them set for every 3 mins but they fail to let me when I get new tweets. It's been 3 weeks and the notifications STILL don't won't and Android 7.0 devices they don't work on my Nexus 6P or my V20. The app did no one any good when you can't even get new tweets 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10057:	   It's tricky to use with multiple accounts and no way to view "activity" in addition to "mentions". Also found it would hang while fetching new tweets or silently fail at refreshing. I like the dark colour theme and a lot of the design, but it's not reliable enough for me. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10071:	  After latest update @ Tab not working. All mention tweets disappeared. Kindly fix. Or can I roll back?... ***update*** Didn't realize @ icon has been changed to 'Bell'. Everything working fine now. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10076:	  Cannot authenticate more users at this time? Any fix? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10080:	   This is brilliant app. Hope you guys will add poll and video option in next update. GROUP DMs not working. ADD POLL AND VIDEO OPTION and Group DMs are not showing. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10083:	   Can't load all replies ? What the hell is that all about. Can't see any tweet interaction ! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10086:	   It just crashes and stops responding way too much. I've had to reinstall it twice because of constant crashing on startup. It's well on its way, but the stability issues are too much to be able to rely on. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10093:	   Really love this twitter app, but im not getting any mentions. if i check my other Twitter app, mentions are there. any advise please 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10095:	   Looked promising app, but not working.. flags network error on RT even though I'm connected to working Wi-Fi 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10099:	   Can't get notified when specific persons I follow, tweet. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10101:	   Everything is perfect about this app EXCEPT you can't upload videos. Kind of a big deal. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10105:	  The app is better than most out there. The layout is efficient and easy to use. My only issues are that it does not send me notifications or message updates. If those were fixed would definitely give it a 4 star ratings. UPDATE: Had to uninstall due to the fact that I didn't get notifications or message updates. Real shame. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10111:	   Everytime I refresh some new trend, it changed everytime i refreshed hahaha. Please make some fix for trend because I don't know what's trending are popular right time 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10112:	  crash on login. android 6.0 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10115:	   But cannot load all the conversation. So I cannot use it. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10123:	   1: the most important thing is to add a material desing in the app not just a twitt button . 2 : this blue color is bad on the app you need to make it more bluer 3 : i cant copy the twitt why ? 4 : you need to make the load for videos and pic faster ( some times the pic and videos don't work as will laging and freezing on it ) 5 : i think you forgottn to make the pic don't count from the 140 ;) ou can make it wonderful twitter app thx for this app :) 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10128:	  I don't get the notification  
org.mariotaku.twidere#10130:	   Merges multiple accounts into one timeline and there is no way to get around that. This is ridiculous. only recommended if you have one account. seeing one timeline is impossible. App appears to be a copycat of Plume minus the ads in many ways. App is missing translate feature. Trends feature doesn't work. Interactions missing features too. it's not intuitive as well. rather complicated. So very few downloads. not recommended. Avoid 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10136:	  I've already updated to latest version,but it can't load images. Can you fix it? Thx 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10145:	   System error 500 I can sign in on my browser but not through the app. Please fix 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10152:	   Pretty good. Anyway to fix the refresh issue dev other than wiping data? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10153:	   This superior alternative to the official twitter app was working perfectly before. As usual, I immediately regret updating it due to regressions. (Intermittently stops loading anything, sometimes even mere seconds after restart) I don't get why this happens with every major update of this app, but I should have known and have waited. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10155:	   Crashes, search not working properly, unneccessary permissions enabled by default. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10156:	   Refresh is broken, links constantly fail to open, pictures won't expand, all requ8ring a force close to fix. Wtf did you guys do?! Or have I hit the wall and it's only a useful app for a certain period of time... 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10159:	   Thank you for the new update, but i always want to make it better and better, i don't know why it takes so longg time to load tweets in timeline since i left my previous phone xperia z2, i think this app doesn't work well on my current phone samsung galaxy s7 edge, your help will be really appreciated 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10164:	   Continually fails to post tweets. Draft tweets can't be deleted (if they can, it's not obvious how). GUI is generally unintuitive. Overall, pretty damn useless... 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10173:	   Unread counts and notifications are completely out of sync since the first 3.1 release that brought bugs right back to this program. The counter doesn't appear on the tabs anymore, and the notification never resets its own counter unless manually cleared 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10176:	   I loved this at first other than the multiple accounts sharing a timeline. I just disabled the accounts when I needed to, so no big deal. But as of late. My feed doesn't refresh, even manually. Pictures won't expand, and some videos and gifs won't load. Gifs also completely stop my media player so it's annoying even viewing a gif. You can't click to see who liked your tweets and you won't ever get notified for dms. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10177:	   I tried a bunch of twitter apps and was all set to love this one, but I couldn't upload pics at all thanks to "." Shame, liked the app pretty well otherwise, but that's a necessarily function missing. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10178:	   1. This app is great and customizable but it's still missing some important things.. I somehow can't get quote and faves to show up on Interaction. Then there is no Poll option. It would be great if twidere has those fixed.. that if it's possible, knowing that twidere is a 3rd party app and it has its limitation. 2. Just now, the timeline can't be refreshed. It seems the problem is not from twitter or my internet connection because they both work well. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10180:	  Problem Installing it. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10182:	   Mostly good but I cannot figure out how to get it to stop running in background, which is why I uninstalled eventually. Also, needs to keep reloading pictures a: when a tweet is seen in timeline b: when one clicks on the picture c: when the phone is turned to the side and the screen changes. This is a serious problem on low bandwidth and limited data. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10184:	  Does not work 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10186:	   I've used this and it's gooodd it's like Twitter on steroid but today I . Hope it'll be fixed. Thank you 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10189:	   I love the interface but, even after refreshing, the app fails to show me tweets and notifications that I have received on the main app. Wanted to used this because it has amoled mode, but if I dont get all my notifications its useless 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10192:	   Can no longer use custom consumer keys. That was the defining feature of this client. Five stars again if it ever gets fixed. [EDIT]: It was fixed. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10194:	   The dark AMOLED theme is a favorite. Its just that the notifications don't work. Everything else works great. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10196:	   Error 400 all day. Sux, gotta uninstall and use official garbage twitter app till addressed 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10198:	   It doesn't show replies (rarely and partly do) please fix this. Every account can be customized to different side color in the timeline (nice) contrary to a review I read before. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10201:	   I can't vote or see vote option,please fix 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10204:	   Would be almost perfect if every update didn't break something. This time, images fail to load after refreshing unless I manually flush the cache 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10213:	   Like it but some annoying issues. Whenever i leave the timeline & return, it will reload whatever that it has already uploaded earlier. I have to wait before getting to continue reading my tweets. Why the need to keep reloading (unless i refresh it)? Does not remember last read position even after i set it in the settings. Every time i click out of timeline & return, i'll have to scroll & search where i stopped earlier. Please fix & it'll be a 5 star worthy app. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10218:	   The app it's OK but, the little problem that I'm having is that I only need the trending topic of Latin and north America, and the app is giving me the TT of the hole world which is ridiculous 'cause I don't need the TT from Asia, please give us an option to select the Area of the TT that we want to see. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10220:	   Found this app after being frustrated by Plume. Great app, both in functionality and design! The only minor issue I sometimes encounter is that an image cannot be shown full-screen. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10223:	  One issue. Where is my time line of the people I follow? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10226:	   Dear developers. We'll done on creating an app fo Twitter that feels nice to use and looks good. One issue I do have is the inability to carry on down to look at older tweets on my feed. The official app has the same issue and it's really annoying. Not everything is only relevant in the 24 hours (or less) after it is posted. Otherwise I've enjoyed using the app and prefer to the official and the couple unofficial I have tried 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10228:	  Beautiful and nicelly functional app but there is some kind of bug in Interactions - I see only replies and no likes/retweets regardless the setting. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10229:	   Interactions is missing favourites & retweets. Font colour is a bit too bright on the dark theme. Square profile pictures doesn't work for DM. And many settings have only one option, so why are they even there?.. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10234:	   It's great. I just need to you to fix the multiple notifications about messages that have already been read . **UPDATE** What did you lot do to this app? It was working perfectly fine before this update, now I don't get notifications and I cant search for anything! Fix it please! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10241:	   I don't see the timeline only pages, dose anyone have the same problem?? I'm confused  
org.mariotaku.twidere#10245:	   love everything but it worst because Can't use DM group 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10254:	   I don't get notifications of any of my mentions and only got to realize this when using the Web version of Twitter. Even after reinstalling and going over settings extensively. Otherwise would have been a great app. EDIT: also please fix the search bar. One can't edit the search bar after it has already shown results of a previous search, and has to go back to the search page for the search icon 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10259:	   Doesn't load media at times. Even on refresh. Sharing is still a problem. VINES collaboration very necessary. So much potential in this app. Work hard on this! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10267:	   Function looks fine in 3.1.6, but I have a problem with soild white screen when I tap to see user's profile. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10268:	   Authorized it, but does not load tweets. Cannot add tabs. Empty screen with only settings panes 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10280:	   I just downloaded the app and after setting it up I went to my page to get a picture for something. I have a took of pictures posted but none loaded on the media tab. Pls fix 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10296:	  Doesn't work 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10306:	   Loading tweet gaps now doesn't work and sometimes it has problems loading pictures :-( 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10307:	   When im trying to load photos at times the app crashes :( otherwise this app is perfect 10/10 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10308:	  I love twidere, the UI is simplistic and very user-friendly. I just wish I could receive DM notification. I have changed the consumer key/secret and have received the full interaction tab (RT, favourite, quote and mentions) but no DM notification. Am I doing something wrong because I tried finding solution on github and couldn't find any. Thanks! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10311:	   I don't like the fact that I have to open media (pic, gif, videos) in browser. If not, there was only blank and black page when i clicked on the media. I have to uninstall because it was troublesome. Other than that, i really love the customizable features in it. I really hope there will be improvement regarding the media problem. Thank you very much. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10321:	   Please fix push notifications ! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10322:	  Was pretty stoked to switch twitter apps since Plume was failing for me, but even they don't cover the majority of options including the send tweet button when composing a tweet! How is that an oversight? Or maybe it's just a problem with Swiftkey users? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10330:	  Dev was quick to fix a bug that made it impossible to compose tweets, best dev and best Twitter app! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10331:	   That Apps says my device incompatible.. Now i cannot use Twidere again :( 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10334:	   Only complaint is with the last update the navigation bar up top disappears when I'm scrolling through my feed. Is there an option to remove this? I could not find one. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10336:	   The most beautiful, slick & smart Twitter app I've used by far. A couple of major issues though (otherwise I'd readily rate 5 stars): (1) Trend location allows user to specify - great - but it doesn't display the correct local trends? (2) Notifications: Only displays responses to @user - doesn't show any other interactions sadly? (3) Twitter polls aren't shown / enabled. Much appreciated!  
org.mariotaku.twidere#10340:	   However, notifications don't work. :( 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10342:	   Really loving the app, but had to revert to the previous version after the last update lost the unread tweets counter. Also, although the media preview works fine, full images don't always load. This has been an issue for a while. Please fix. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10343:	   Great app, great UI. Thanks.. Edit: Conversations do not load mostly. They say some policies. But fenix loads it. I don't get notifications/even in app notifications when someone starts following me/or mentions/reply. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10347:	   I've known about Twidere for years, but for some reason I never made the switch until today. This is by far the best Twitter app I've ever used. There's just one thing that keeps it from being flawless, and that's the search history that I can't seem to clear or disable. Gmail does something similar and it's always bugged me to no end. Maybe there's an option I'm missing that gets rid of it. Other than that, this is fantastic and it's always nice to see third-party open-source Twitter applications. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10354:	   I love customization and this is an awesome app, but I don't get notified when someone follows me 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10359:	  The only major problem is Twidere can't reliably load older tweets. That issue makes Twidere half-useless for me. I have to switch to another app to read all the tweets I missed! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10363:	   When clicking on a thumbnail image on my timeline, it loads but then shows a black screen and doesn't load the image. Very annoying, used to work perfectly. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10364:	   Has not fixed proxy bypass. This is a major security problem. Developer doesn't care. This is the second time I've been hit by this app. I no longer can recommend it. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10370:	   Twidere is simply the most customizable app. But needs more features such as photo-tagging feature, schedule tweets, ability to retweet from other accounts, live streaming timeline, tweeting beyond 140 character limit via TwitLonger and more, but also fix the likes feature because I have difficulty liking tweets . But all in all, the best app so far. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10374:	   I love the way this looks and feels, but the bugs are killing me. Images randomly won't load in full screen, new tweet counts don't appear on my tabs despite being turned on in my settings. Makes using this app totally frustrating. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10398:	   the apps it's really cool than beeter but im not able to see my direct messages even i already setup for allowing read and send direct messages. pls fix it. and i will give 5 stars 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10404:	   I love this app, but for one issue that has only appeared in recent updates. I can see a posted partial image in the card, but when I open the tweet I get a blank screen. I have to open the image up in the browser to see it. Frustrating. Have deleted and reinstalled app to no avail. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10405:	   Couldn't find any replacement for Falcon Pro which was going buggy each passing day. This seems a worthy contender. The initial setup requires some work but once you've set it up to your liking, it's great! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10413:	   Absolutely love this app, but really, really wish accidentally pressing the back-button while in my timeline (or changing orientation) wouldn't send me to the top of my timeline on next open. The developer has done great work on this app, and I'm grateful for it, but very annoying bug. When fixed, will give 5 stars. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10417:	   Please fix the media preview. It stopped working after the update!! Thanks. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10419:	  Nice, but can improve. Hope it doesnt start crashing like other clients 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10424:	   It had loading problems few days ago but thankfully it's been repaired. It's so good  If only we can see polls and can press enter in direct messages, I can call it flawfree ~ 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10425:	   The TL can't reload every time i open twidere. Love the previous one 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10426:	   Before the update it was a beautiful app full of functions and usefulness, but simply didn't work. Update has fixed loading problems and it works beautifully as it looks. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10427:	   The left side column(accounts, settings, filters etc.) has gone. Please fix 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10439:	  i really love to use this app, but in this two days, I have problems on reloading new tweets in timeline or a specific tabs. please update. I really don't like to give you guys only 2 stars 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10440:	   i thought it was because of my device, but quite a lot users have the same issue. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10443:	   Every so often refuses to update time line. Reinstalling seems to be the only fix. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10445:	   The UI is nice but its very unstable at the moment I often find that my feed cannot refresh. Sometimes I also have problems getting tweets to send. At the moment it's not loading at all :( 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10447:	   When it works out is great, but after the last few updates I have been having issues with refreshes not working or being really slow. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10451:	   I would like to see the tabs scale to the display size on landscape mode - if I only have 2 tabs, it only takes up half of the screen. Wasted space is you ask me. Also how do I see who favourites my tweets? Pressing the number of favourites doesn't do anything and in the notifications I don't get any about who favourited the tweet. Fix that and the app will be perfect. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10452:	  I love this app, but still buggy. Notifications are not working and the sometimes the refresh stucks in. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10455:	  Well designed but lacking. Needs notifications for favorites and the ability to see polls. Also has a big issue right now with the feed not refreshing. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10456:	   Hasn't worked in days. Last update broke it and it just spins instead of loading. Have gone back to using Twitter website until fixed. Pretty much hasn't worked in a week. One of my devices hasn't been able to update the feed since right after the super bowl. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10457:	   There seems to be some sort of connection issue, the timeline just won't load, would be great if this could be fixed as soon as possible. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10458:	   Please fix 'read from bottom' & 'stay on last tab before closing' features 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10460:	   I've adored this app for ages and im so sad that is just doesn't work anymore after the last few updates. I hope you fix it 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10461:	   After last update it wouldn't update profile nor timeline. It did for a while now it's not working again. Please fix it. Btw best twitter client when it wokrs (using lg g3) 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10462:	   Please fix it. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10464:	  If you find after the update that you loose all your tweets and the refresh hangs or does nothing. Just un-install the app and re-install got things working again for me. You loose all your preferences but small price to pay to get this app working again. Possible that the app makers need to review there upgrade methodology as something needs fixing! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10470:	   The latest version seems to have made the refresh issues worse. Killing the app & restarting also doesn't help. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10471:	   Nice design and easy to use but I have a problem when loading new tweets sometime. They're not response new tweets. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10473:	   I might not be patient enough to wait for you to fix this. Slow update makes it useless! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10474:	  Would have rated this 4 or even 5 stars but latest version is not working at all - All previous tweets gone and unable to refresh no matter how I tried; no errors or feedback. Had to revert to the previous version 0.3.0 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10476:	   Refresh was fixed.......for about 10mins and now isnt working again. Please sort out, I don't want to have to go back to the native twitter app....please don't make me. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10478:	   The latest update fixed the issues, as far as I can tell. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10480:	  The latest update isn't working properly. Feed won't refresh on startup. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10482:	   This lovely program become not working as it should since updated ... just blank in every tab ... please fix it ... 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10485:	   Refresh doesn't work... Nothing works actually... 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10486:	   The current version doesn't let me refresh my feeds unless I post something. Very inconvenient, please fix. Thank you 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10488:	   Really upset the backwards refresh is not working in this latest update. I am unable to check my timeline from last night to view critical conversations. i loved this app before the last update happened Please fix this and I'll change my rating. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10489:	   Please fix  
org.mariotaku.twidere#10492:	   Latest update has an issue. I cant refresh my content whenever i pull down screen to refresh 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10497:	   New update cannot open image when click link 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10498:	   It was great till the last version, i cant download anything vid or pic +sudden crashes 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10499:	   Can't refresh. Can't tweet. Not working at all please fix it 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10500:	   Hello, this app is the best and I really love it, but in direct messages have a lot of problems. Doesn't have any kind of options like share, expand image or even copy and when ppl share a link you don't receive the complete link so you can't see what others shared with you. Plis fix to put 5* again. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10509:	   Quite like the layout but it constantly has problems with sending messages and updating the timeline so going to try a another client. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10513:	   Please add Tweet marker! Also one problem, does not save position of last tweet. It will refresh to the top of the list on home even though it is disabled 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10518:	  Great UI with material design. But sometimes it's too slow and has problems in loading videos and pictures. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10525:	   After coming from iOS, I struggled to find a twitter client I liked. This is the best I've used, not quite as good as tweetbot (iOS) but the best android one, the only feature its missing is streaming. Also there's no sync options, just blank!? Also when opening tweets from chrome I wish it was a bit wider, say 80% width. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10526:	   I'm using Twidere over all other options but it has persistent issues. It frequently stops updating, requiring a force close to fix. And also the notification behaves poorly, and doesn't update the new tweet count based on the count in the app - the only thing that sets the notification count to zero is swiping away the notification, not actually reading tweets. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10531:	  It can't open any twitter pics for a long time 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10539:	   You log in, and you are ready to go. It's easy to use. It's customisable. It's beautiful. Every Twidere will looks different. With a lot of features Twidere is the only client that never lacks of features. The developer listen to you and try to fix bugs as fast as possible. It's also free AND ad-free. This is how you browse Twitter! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10542:	   however, is it just me or the "activities by friends" tab doesn't work? it simply won't load anything, what i got is just a blank tab. (fyi, the "activities about me" tab works well, though). did i miss something on setting or what? pls enlighten me 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10545:	   Worked for like a day. Then had inexplicable network issues, even when no other app had problems - including the stock Twitter app. Samsung S6 Edge+ 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10558:	   I can't write a Japanese text, so please fix this :) i love this app 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10559:	   Why is there no option to delete DMs? And sometimes when I switch from wifi to data, I get a network error despite having a connection 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10562:	   The app doesn't load any videos or pictures, the notifications says it was bug, can you fix it ? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10566:	   The best app for Twitter I've found. But there's a bug in the Following list: sometimes doesn't appear nothing there. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10576:	   Can't use it. Apparently need a "consumer key" to use it. Total waste. Deleted forever. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10579:	   I can mostly only see the pictures in the previews... When I click on it, it is just black, although it finished loading. Please fix this problem 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10581:	   To no surprise, most (if not all) of the bugs got patched out. With that, this has become the most stable Twitter app. Some new features added would be nice, though. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10592:	   I have a Nexus 4. And I'm not able to pay the videos in the app. Pls help me fix this. Thanks. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10593:	   Its good.... just I can't seem to edit my profile picture or change the other media settings. Please fix 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10594:	   Don't get notified on who follows me, likes or retweets me. Which at this point should be a main stay on every app if they want to stand out from the default app. Also where can I see my retweets? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10595:	  List menu crashed - fixed. Thankyou 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10598:	   Smooth with great design and customizability. No matter how you change the color or the tabs or the font, it always adapt to look well designed and perfect. Just what I wanted when the original Twitter app kept crashing on me. Thanks. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10599:	   The App is fine. I've solved the Issue 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10603:	   The app is promising, and I like the way it only asks for the permissions that it really needs. I tried it for 6 months but, crashing or freezing at least once a day, it just wasn't stable enough for my needs. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10604:	   Time line was not refreshing, previews took seconds to load, when manually refreshed missed tweets. Good UI, nice design but basics just don't work. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10619:	   I loved that I could customize tabs with this app, and access my lists instead of the entire list of people I followed, but after being unable to refresh them for four days, I tried to delete and add the list back. Twidere crashed every time I tried to access my lists. If this gets fixed, let me know- unfortunately, as this was the feature that drew me to this app, I'm looking for an alternative now. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10620:	   I love this app, but it needs group dm support. It's very inconvenient to switch apps to see my group dm messages. Thanks. 5 stars when you can fix that. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10621:	    not working, seems like it works for only recently engaged usuernames and not all your followers. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10622:	   Recent update caused it to crash every time i try to view a list or add a list as a new tab, very frustrating as i need my lists to manage the thousands of people i follow 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10625:	   Twidere crash when i try to open it, i have a wiko rainbow under jelly bean. Please fix it, i would like to have this app 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10626:	   Everything is great but the app crashes whenever I try to open "lists" 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10630:	   good to know EXACTLY which bugs are ALLEGEDLY FIXED with each update. thanks for not blowing away my keys with each update. hate having to restore them. making good progress. maybe... 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10635:	   It doesn't load group conversation in DM 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10639:	   y i can't see pics n videos?????????? it irritates me plzzzzzz do fix it plzzzzzzz 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10641:	   Great app but must be improved.. Excellent ui but has a little lag while scrolling .. And Refreshing when pull down didnt work sometimes if even excellent network, please fix it.. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10645:	  This app is awesome. Sure you can find some errors while using it but come on, someone has taken time to do an open source app so you can have a non-ad free forever Twitter app. It works great, it is always improving and it has everything you can already find in twitter. The material design is beautifully made and the logo design is the best. Thank you for your time to do this awesome app. I update this opinion to say that I had to uninstall the app, it had a hard time refreshing the timeline and it has become outdated since the new twitter features. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10656:	   Great looks and customisation but won't let me follow new people. Fix this please because I actually like this app would like to give it more stars. Thanks. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10660:	   Recently switched to a Galaxy S6, and now the app lags when moving too fast through the tweets. Also, sometimes I can't get new tweets, even though my Internet connection is fine. Otherwise, best twitter app for catching up on news and people. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10663:	   Why there is no widget? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10665:	   Can't find the timeline. All is wants me to do is make tabs... Wtf.. Uninstalling right now 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10671:	  Nice app, but it says "no network access" with 4G and WiFi fully in service 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10678:	   Editing photos when tweeting not working though (i click edit but nothing happens?). Missing the interactions tab. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10683:	   I can't find out who followed me on Twitter 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10686:	   Very nice Twitter client..! :D but I found a problem that the pinned tweet is not supported for now. (Tweets can't to be a pinned, Pinned tweet doesn't move to top of timeline in profile page...e.t.c) I hope that would be implemented in future updates. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10687:	   All I can see on my own page is blank. Please fix it. I will re-rate the app then. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10688:	   Setting a custom notification ringtone doesn't work. Just uses the default one. Really nice design, smooth interface, but a bit buggy. I like to know when I'm getting a tweet vs a text. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10689:	   From few days it was working good but now couldn't load the tweets properly..... Few this bug asap 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10691:	  bug: does not show all replys of a tweet. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10692:	   Overall a beautiful and well working app. But there are two issues: in messages, the enter key does not work as a ljne break, even if "enter for send" is deactivated. Second, the edit media button does nothing for me. I would like to at least be able to crop a picture. Will give 5 stars if these are changed. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10693:	   It's bugging me that no new notifications are sent after new people followed me, and no notifications on who retweeted or favorites my tweets. but other than that it's really a well made app and should recognized more. Keep up the good work. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10695:	   Get an "Error:Unknown error, this is probably a bug" message anytime I click on a picture to open it from my timeline 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10696:	   I cant tweet using twidere becoz of this API things apps. Please fix this. I really like Twidere Apps. But please no more Key and Secret API twitter. I can't tweet. Read only. I wanna give 5stars but please no more API 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10697:	   The only issue I'm experiencing is that it will periodically stop loading new tweets when I refresh. I have to force close and re-open to get things working again. I don't know if this is a known issue, but once it's fixed I'm definitely giving 5 stars. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10699:	  This apps is good but i can't get the notifications when people mention me and i would love if i can see people who retweet and favourite my tweets. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10702:	  as a twitter user 24/7, the customization features which the twitter app doesnt have fulfill this app, however it has synchronization issues e.g loading new tweets, sending tweets and inability to edit photos like cropping on the spot but the rest are perfect! Will highly recommend this if the issues will be fixed. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10710:	   This app is kind of OK nowadays. The interface is still great, but weird bugs ruin the experience. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10712:	   AVG has begun flagging the app as malware, specifically adware. Is there a reason why this has begun after years without issue? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10714:	  After trying almost every free Twitter app out there this is what I was looking for. THIS is how you do a Twitter client right. Theme and card customization. Tabbing for what I want with icons and ability to reorder. Incoming DM's that don't get shortened and ability to send long DM's unlike Twittnuker. One thing I would ask for is more tab icon options. Twittnuker has a few more icon options. Any extras would be nice, but I personally would prefer icons representing something with music, movies, books, and games for different list types. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10715:	   Lots of bugs, for instance I had to restart before the tabs were actually there. Otherwise it just keeps requesting you to make tabs. Then I tried to send a message, but the send button doesn't seem to be working. It's a pity really, it's very pretty but at this point unusable. Hope it gets more stable in the future! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10721:	   I'm not sure what the issue is but I can't seem to open some pictures. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10722:	   I couldn't find the WiFi streaming option! Is it there, or not? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10726:	   consumer secret? consumer key? tbh i dont know. whats that? i skip that step then try to sign in but failed bcs of "API incorrect / cs&ck" give me some helpful answer pls! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10730:	   I love the interface and all but it would be nice to be able to delete a conversation in a DM. Only then will it get 5 stars. Also, I'm finding it difficult to send images via DM. And it keeps crashing. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10732:	   Why I can't find the setting menu? Respons please.. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10734:	  Obviously a bit of a work-in-progress but certainly good work! Handles multiple accounts with shared timelines, so already streaks ahead of other Material Design Twitter apps. A few bugs here and there, but it's customisable enough to adapt to most casual uses. Overall a great app, it'll be a shame when Twitter forces its users elsewhere. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10743:	  Multiple accounts with merged timelines are a big plus! Seems to run fairly well. Despite developer's claims to the contrary, it constantly loses your timeline place. Doesn't load all missing tweets. Doesn't reset notifications when you get new mentions. Fix these issues and it would be the best Twitter client I've ever used. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10745:	   Once again the app is updated and something is ruined. Can only enlarge SOME pics through pic preview. Please fix this. I now have to stop updating because I have no idea what's being broken the next time you send out an update. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10749:	   I used this before my s4 was updated and it was excellent! Now, it crashes and for some reason i cant even log in. It states, network error when all my other apps are working well with my 4g. So i cant seem to detect the problem. Pls solve this! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10751:	   This app has an excellent, highly customisable user interface and all the features I need - I've uninstalled Falcon Pro 3 and Plume. The fact that this app is free, ad-free and open source shows that the developer cares less about money and more about actually making a great Twitter client. It has a few bugs, but none that stop this app from being a pleasure to use. The screenshots don't make it look that impressive, but I definitely recommend trying it out. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10753:	   Tried using the codes in the description but they don't work?? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10754:	  I can't open the app 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10755:	  New update crashes occasionally. Please fix. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10757:	   since the last version (out today) I can't play videos anymore (causes a crash), and I randomly crash when the UI is active or not. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10762:	   The UI is perfect. The odd bugs were fixed and am now a happy Twidere user! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10766:	   This is one of the best twitter apps out there. Clean design, lots of customization and very lite. It's still an on going project and there are bugs, but I'd love to keep testing it. Thanks a lot for this wonderful app. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10767:	  When I try to change the font, it doesn't work. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10770:	   Liked it alot i had a few bugs were it wont refresh other then that all good 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10780:	  Would rate 5 Star but for some reason I cannot receive DMs to my client, sending works fine, really frustrating and will force me to switch client again if I can't find a solution! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10781:	   Please fix the Limit Token ASAP!!! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10800:	   Can't see who retweeted or favorited user's tweet and mine too. Fix this and I'll give you 5 stars. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10802:	   I love a lot about this application, but it does have bugs. Sometimes it won't refresh and I have to force close it and open it back up. Also, there is no view within the app for notifications and clicking on favorite/retweet counters doesn't show who favorited/retweeted. The biggest but, though, is that if you don't use it for a few hours, it can be missing a lot of tweets that would show up in the official app. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10805:	  Minor refresh issues & 'save search' snafus, but basically a premium twitter client for the princely sum of $no money. Well done devs. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10807:	  So far I like this application. its light and easy to use. It just that why the notification come so late. Truthfully I still use another application, but twidere's notification come soooo late. Hope you fix it.. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10823:	   Clean, no frills twitter app. I'm excited to see how this app will improve in the coming months. I'm sure the tweet font style not updating will be fixed soon enough. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10826:	   Still need so many fixes. It's great, but really.. seriously need fixes 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10829:	   Installed with app key and everything, but it doesn't work. Get 401 error every time. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10834:	   I can't see who favourite my tweets. Please fix it. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10835:	   Same issue here.. So can't use it on my tablet :( 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10840:	   Bug if i open a tweet and see the count of retweets favs etc when i click on one of those respective symbols it doesnt show who favorited it or retweeted. Also when i click on favorited to see who favorited it it says" users that retweeted this" its gettinf better overall though. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10850:	   Doesn't show me how many letters have left to type in a direct message. When I typed too long or was blocked by message limit Twidere didn't give any error message to explain it. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10852:	   already enable unread count on settings yet still didnt appear on tab. please fix this. and how to enable Compose Now feature on my oneplus one? last time i use Twidere on my Moto G, it works. but since i change my device to OnePlus One, it didn't work. please fix this. i love that featur so much. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10859:	  Needs bug fixes with saving settings and unread counts. Other than that, nice app. I would also recommend including a notification tab that holds favorites, retweets, and mentions all in one tab. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10861:	   This was just awesome remembers hashtags :-) helpful and smooth but just doesn't load lately even after reboots July 2015 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10863:	   One thing that bothers me: the top bar is not bold color instead of gradient color, that isn't in appropriate material design layout. Please fix this, thank you so much for developing this app. We'll always support you guys.  
org.mariotaku.twidere#10864:	  I like everything about it the UI is very clean. the only problem I have is how do you view peoples photos from their profile? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10869:	   A really nice designed app, but buggy as hell. Often I have to restart it in order for it to return to function properly! Please fix this (nexus5, lollipop 5.1.1) 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10871:	   Last few updates have made almost unusable. Will not refresh feed, will not send tweets until restart then is OK again for a while. Reinstalled to see if that helps issues, now needs to collect stats for some other app, cannot disable, Uninstalled permanently, privacy hazard now 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10872:	  Does not work with 2fa 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10874:	   Overall it's far better than the vanilla twitter client, but sadly, the edit media option is defunct and the mentions tabs don't show favourites and retweets from other users to your tweets. Will change to 5 stars after that is fixed. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10875:	   Not a bad program, but as soon as I installed my account was starting to follow multiple users I wasn't aware of. I'm not sure if this issue with the app or my account so I'm not going to hold the Ap responsible but there was a lot of lag issues and issues trying to post and follow other people on Twitter. I'm giving 2 stars for now until the issues are fixed and I can straighten out my account 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10878:	   The first few tweets on the home tab are dated November or October but I checked the profile and it does not match the date it was posted. Please fix. Thanks. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10888:	   there's a bug, when u are trying to reply, app set user nickname after @, not twitter user name. Like @Ivan Ivanov instead of @Ivanoff scroll between tabs is buggy, a lot of lags here and there. Launching animation is different on android 5 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10890:	   The @Mentions column doesn't work and I'm constantly getting notifications about mentions I've already read. Please fix. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10894:	   With the last update, my timeline don't refresh! The app is so goog before the last update. Fix, please! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10895:	   Come on guys, now I can't even log in. It says it is the incorrect password or username when I know it's right. I have set my account to ask for permission if I wanted to access my account, and fix web login 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10898:	   403 error while logging in with correct credentials 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10899:	   error 403 - this app  more users. how to fix this? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10905:	   I think twidere for twitter is the best twitter client with nice interface and nice performance. But please fix this trouble. Sometimes when I swap screen to left, there is a grey blank space in the right side and I can't move it. Btw in addition, please add "back to top" :D and now I'm waiting for twidere for facebook :3 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10907:	   Love the design and the app itself! But one problem is that I can't play video with sound.. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10911:	   Don't get me wrong I love this app, but maybe make it so I can get a notification when someone retweets, and favorites. Please update that other than that, FANTASTIC Also if you could make it so I can get push notifications as soon as it happens rather than when I open the app it happens? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10912:	   I just fall in love with everything other than the problem. You can always change the setting to see tweets refreshed from latest to newest or otherwise, my problem is that I have chosen the shortest interval but still having trouble to refresh new tweets. Also, you can always change the pic to be a link or not. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10914:	   I like how this app is. It's easy to use. The only thing I wish it did was quote tweets like it does in the Twitter Android app and I don't get all of the tweets in my feed. Otherwise great app 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10915:	  While I enjoy the UI, multi-account tweeting, etc. It has ridiculous loading times, sometimes not even loading the tweet/picture/profile and instead giving you an error. It notifies you of an interaction as late as FORTY MINUTES later. Definitely NOT a good alternate Twitter app. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10916:	   This would be 4, maybe 5 stars if notifications weren't a problem. There's no way to control how often the accounts sync, so notifications are several minutes behind the Twitter app, if I see them at all. I wanted to replace the Twitter app, but the slow and erratic notifications prevent me from doing so. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10920:	  Load more tweets doesn't work properly, sometimes is missing too 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10928:	   The light theme with transparency is broken. Fix it and the fifth star is yours! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10929:	   This app is like twicca - fast, free and customizable but also looks great on modern android handsets. Only issue for me is that the transparency slider for the background doesn't work. EDIT: wish there was a way to change the colour of the floating "new tweet" button. There's no contrast between the button and the timeline. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10930:	   Previously I Am Used Fenix App As A Twitter But Fenix Have Some Missing Tweets Problem. This App Deserve Good Rating Because Its Have Better UI & More Innovative Features . Good Job Developer  
org.mariotaku.twidere#10932:	  Trending doesn't work 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10933:	   After half an hour of failure I gave up, totally unintuitive interface. Perhaps I need to understand Twitter but it left me utterly confused. Uninstalled. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10937:	   I've using Twidere since I got my smartphone and I like it. Recently though it doesn't load more tweets after I click load more. I will change this review if this gets fixed. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10938:	  Really want to like this app. I'm having issues with when I pull down to refresh it won't pull the full history of tweets I missed (even when pressing the load more option). Other than that I am digging this app for all the below commented reasons. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10939:	   I love the design and the open source mindset. However, the refresh to load previous tweets function is not working, and i feel tweets are being skipped. This issue did not exist before, so please fix. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10941:	   Since last update it will not load old messages 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10942:	   Though, I wish there was an option to color the FAB any color you want and also I can't get the sound of videos to work. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10947:	  I want to like this app because it's lovely, but it appears to be skipping tweets. It loads an incredibly small number of tweets at a time upon refresh, and hitting the Load More line fails to load the tweets in between. This is literally the exact reason I am looking for a replacement for Twicca, since its latest update started doing the same thing. The problem here is, there's no way to force reload the whole timeline to retrieve those missing tweets. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10948:	   Using this app from long time but now I'm having some issues with the timeline. Unable to load more than 200 tweets and sometimes image doesn't load. Please fix this asap. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10951:	   This is the first app I've installed that won't open in the Android M preview. I get that it's still a beta, which is why I gave it 5 stars (don't want to affect their ratings based on a beta) but it's disappointing since it's the only Twitter client that doesn't have sketchy permissions. Not sure what could be causing the error but let me know once you've sorted it. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10952:	   When i start using this apps, everything is ok.. but after being a long time, it can't get to refresh the older post.. fix please.. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10955:	   Love the look, and it's quite smooth most of the time, but it crashes from time to time, and with the latest update (I think), the Load More button after the most recent tweets doesn't seem to work - loading icon appears for a half second the goes, and the tweets aren't shown. Shame. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10960:	   I love the app and the interface etc. But can't seem to tweet photos from camera or gallery. Fix this and I'll give it a 5 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10961:	   The best twitter client out there but I don't understand why this app doesn't load the replies. After all those updates it's still suffering from the same problem. Please fix this and I'll make this my only twitter app. This bug is the only reason I'm still using the official twitter app 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10963:	   More importantly open source. Can't get any better! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10980:	   I really like being able to change how it looks and all the open source stuff. The main reason I was looking for a new twitter app is the official one only showing a certain number of tweets on a person's profile.. but this one seems to show all tweets. The one thing I couldn't work out is why I can't see who has favourited a tweet. I can't find a notification tab for it or even if I click on the number of favourites on the tweet nothing happens. I think I will stick with this app though..seems good. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10988:	  Cool but I can't load group message sadly. And it will be perfect if you add notifications bar instead of mentions. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10993:	   When I play videos in the app there is no sound. My volume is maxed and no other issues other than this app. I really like it but fix this twitter video problem & it's great 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10994:	   No widget though. Shame. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#10997:	   However, the loading symbol never ceases on the trends tab, and a lot of the time tweets don't load at all for me on the timeline/home tab, it just stops. I would love this app if it functioned to the point where I could use it to replace the official Twitter app. But at the moment I don't feel it can. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11001:	   This app is perfect. It's what I've been looking for. My only problem is, is that the audio doesn't load when I play a video -- hence the 4 stars... other than that, great twitter client. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11006:	   I love the UI, and that this is ad-free/open-source. However, a few problems make this app unusable for me. (1) Refreshing the timeline goes to the top, losing my place among the tweets I was reading, requiring a lot of downscrolling to find where I left off. (2) There's no number indicator for how many unread tweets are left. (3) I can't find an obvious way to read a tweet in context of a conversation, which makes many tweets useless. (4) On the trends tab, the loading icon never goes away. (5) Every time I open it, I have to dismiss a notification at the top about "usage statistics". 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11008:	  There are some feauture that are not here. I can't seem to find and to be notified of the people that favorite and retweeted my tweets and I can't find my old pictures that I posted because there's no "gallery/media". Fix these and I'll change my ratings to 5 stars. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11009:	   I love the ui and this app is very customizable, but i found a problem (not sure it is just me or not). I can't add a new tab, when i tap the + button it do nothing. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11012:	   No sound for video and sometime error. Please fix it. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11013:	   You fix the image uploading option. I cannot change my Twitter profile pic and background image through this app. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11021:	  I can't add the tabs. When I click the "+" button, it doesn't works. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11026:	   This app is really cool but i'm sorta having a problem. Vines can't be played on it. And why wouldn't it notify you when someone favorites or retweets your tweet? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11027:	   Twidere! You have the great looks and smooth performance. Please fix the notifications. I cant recieve any :( please update! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11030:	   It keeps giving me error 401 i dont know what to do 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11043:	   I only found a small problem, you can't send photos from the album or camera throught direct message. I have a Samsung S3. I think it's something that could be fixed. Best twitter app 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11045:	   Very promising Twitter application. One problem for me though is the refresh circle does not go away when on the trending tab. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11047:	   Hi. Great app but the only bummer is that no sound is played for videos and vines. Please fix! Thanks. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11049:	   The problem is I can't hear the sounds of any video ...video starts without sounds 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11056:	   I honestly feel like this is the best app for using twitter. However, i cannot view who favorites my tweets. Is this a compatibility issue or is this a problem for all devices? Regardless, if problem is addressed and fixed, this app is easily one of the best apps for social media and gets 5 stars from me. Edit: something else I've noticed, videos have no sound. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11057:	   Fixed the crashing problem. My favourite client once again! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11064:	   What happened to the preview pictures, they have gone, please fix. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11066:	  4/5 on Nexus 4: smooth and effective, though with minor interface glitches. 1/5 on Nexus 9: the tablet interface has this pointless noisy columnar layout, and it crashes ridiculously often. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11067:	   Great material design, but pictures and avatars doesnt load even i have speedy connection. Pls fix 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11068:	   Small additions wanted, some needed, some already on their way, minor bugs and sometimes a few crashes though. Rest is pretty damn good. Best Twitter app by far 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11070:	   It's free, it's pretty, it's customizable, but like a lot of other ones, it's not robust. Notifications don't work and fav/rt counts don't tally. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11072:	   Yup tis a gr8 app.......it doesnt consume much of my memory....also reliable.....bt it wont changing my dp fast....bt as im nt the 1 who change dp daily its ohk....bt it fails to sent tweets sumtimes.....wts the prblm with my time??..eventhough its correct it shows check ur clock...enough with tht 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11076:	   1) Are there any plan to introduce schedule tweet option in twidere? 2) I am looking forward for you to solve the issue with viewing quote tweet soon. 3) I try to delete draft tweet but it takes too long to complete. After few minutes, i decide to force stop 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11078:	   In the past few updates, Twidere become easily force close, especially when loading image with unstable network. Please check since I can't report it via "error dialog" because Google Play Service stopped when trying to report. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11081:	   It doesn't load anything, don't see a home page or anything 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11082:	   A great, light, more customisable and better looking Twitter client, but ONLY PICTURES WORK! No other media, videos, gifs, nothing. Fix it, fix it fast 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11090:	   What happened? They tablet UI is terrible. You can hardly read timeline. Please fix. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11091:	   For some reason the videos that I open won't load 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11096:	   cool i love the design but it always  whenever im looking on someone's profile. pls fix it thx 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11097:	   Love the app deeply but the logo looks unprofessional, it doesn't match my other square snapchat, Facebook and instagram logo, just put it in a white square please, ocd rn please fix 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11110:	   Great app with responsive Dev. Emailed and reviewed with issues and got a response quickly with assurance the issues were being addressed and they were. Latest update fixed my remaining complaint. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11116:	   How do you sign out can't find it. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11121:	   De-installing and re-installing the app (newest version) fixed the Error 404 issue with the image upload. Thanks to the developer! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11122:	   The lollipop overhaul is lovely and a lot of the old issues I used to deal with have been fixed. This isn't just a great FOSS Twitter client, it's a great Twitter client period. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11123:	   [Update]: I can't received any notification from the app even I already enable it, before the material design update there is no problem at all. I have Xperia Z3 Dual 4.4.4. -- I love this app, but there is small problem with notifications, please we need more options for the way of received it, I mean more professional, for example I can't replay the mention one by one in the notification section of my phone, because it's together and simply it's impossible to do what I want with this style. Thank you. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11125:	   Triggers 404 error on attempt to login... 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11126:	   Though , those were pretty fast updates to solve most of the bugs. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11127:	   Longstanding issues with multiple accounts not fixed. Same for not showing discussion history properly. Instead new design that shows less tweets, more buttons, crashes after every tweet, deleted settings after update etc. I`m taking a break. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11129:	  bug 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11130:	   The latest update breaks the media upload; it always gave me a 404 error every time I tried to upload an image. I'm currently using Moto E on stock Lollipop. 3 stars because I used this for ~2 years and can't find any good replacement that isn't Twidere-based. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11136:	   Has a few bugs, but what app doesn't? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11140:	   Loved it till the latest update . Now it doesn't WORK AT ALL. I'm back to using plume *sigh* 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11143:	   The latest version available here is mostly the same as the beta build I've been using for the past month or so and Twidere is back to it's best. Very few issues anymore, just a great twitter client! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11146:	   It just crashes even when not using it. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11158:	   This app have since the launch of lollipop started to randomly crash even when it's just hidden in the background doing nothing! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11160:	   recommended to add new features like multiple photos view and gif photo view. and why my background didnt 'transparent' as you say? also 'late-receiving' notification, its appear only if i open the app. i think you should fix it asap bcs many users liked your app. thankyou 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11162:	   I think this app is great, but this apps will be completely if INTERNAL BROWSER add to inside. So for development please update n fix this. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11166:	   Only one problem..it does not load gif image.. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11167:	   Now the transparent theme doesn't work at all. That set this app apart from all others and the main reason why I started using it again. Now it's just like all other apps. Hopefully you'll activate that transparent theme again. If not, take it out of the theme options since it's misleading. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11168:	   Error while signing in: Error 401 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11170:	  Too many issues now 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11172:	  There's problem with images though. The first two images that load when you log in by default as shown for every other image in every other tweet. Takes time to load to the right image 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11176:	   since i un- and reinstalled twidere and both extensions, streaming extension will ask for permissions every few minutes, but it says there aren't any permissions needed and in the end, it simply doesn't work. kind of sad because there weren't any problems like that before. nice app in general, what i liked most was the streaming possibility. what a pity. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11178:	   i try so hard to make it transparent , but nothing. pls fix it 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11180:	  secret / customer key doesn't work... 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11191:	  Can't sign in if you have two step authentication. I'm allowing access via the official twitter app but this one still gets error 302 when trying to sign in. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11192:	  Was working fine, but now it doesnt Load anyones tweets when you actually go on their profile & then it doesn't allow you to see tweets with multiple pics. Also, doesn't Load the full convo when you press "in reply to". I used to love this app, but the update has set me back. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11197:	  Can't open gifs 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11202:	   I heard it was a great app so tried installing it. But after installing my phone stopped responding and got an error saying 'system UI has stopped working'. I uninstalled and the problem was fixed. Fix this app please. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11208:	   like this app a lot...but got a little prob...i cant see my replies when im want to tweet back... is it the setting or the app problem... 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11215:	   Viewing threads hasn't worked in several versions now and screw that, if it's not fixed soon I need to find something else. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11235:	   understand problems w/'L' caused a back-level version to come out. please fix! love this twitter app... thx 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11240:	  Best Twitter app but its starting to slip,no gif support and since update various issues present. Pity. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11245:	   Latest update breaks this app in almost every way. The devs need to really step up and fix their product or a lot of people will start to find alternative apps. Seems like thisnapp doesn't get the attention it needs any longer. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11246:	   Can't add a Mentions tab without it crashing EVERY SINGLE TIME. Therefore unusable. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11251:	   This is the best twitter app for Android I've found and has a lot of the features from Tweetbot that I loved on iOS. However, trying to work out which account is tweeting from the compose view is completely impossible, and even when i select one it still sometimes tweets from both, which is a bit problem. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11253:	   I like this app. But "Export settings" is not working on my phone. :/ 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11259:	  Great but crashes on my Nexus 9 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11264:	   Very pretty and easy to customize are the highlights of this app. Falls short with some functionality. for example I can add people to lists, block, mute them, etc. however there is no option to remove them from a list, unblock, unmute, etc. In terms of bugs I cannot see reply threads at all. I'm on a note 2 android 4.2.2 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11266:	  Why do everytime i wanna change my profile photo it just wont stop loading and in the end it doesn't change at all? I can't change my profile photo now. Pls fix? Hope to get a feedback or reply. I'd give 5 stars if u fix the problem 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11267:	   After the update it's impossible to mute accounts. Fix that! Good app though. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11275:	   Spent ages. All it would show was a dud list of #tags that I couldn't get past. Tried setting up the account again. Same thing. Couldn't even show basic unfiltered feed. No idea what I did wrong but it shouldn't be this hard. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11276:	   Great app but has many bugs. Lots of features missing like the option to see all of a friends pictures and notifications when a friend follows. The app crashes quite a few times and the following/followers list stops working after a bit. Please fix. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11280:	   "Temporary l fix" not working. Going to look into it, but don't know what I'm doing. Speedy dev help would b amazing considering lollipop is final in a little over a week. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11281:	   PROS: NO ADS! HIGHLY customisable, BEAUTIFUL interface, FAST even on slow networks, smooth, push notifs, easily manage lists/mutes/filters, save Drafts, view Trends... CONS: no tab option for faves of own tweets (only mentions & RTs), viewing replies/conversations is clunky/confusing, gifs &vids (&some pics) won't load, no "near by" stream, no "schedule tweet" feature, app size goes from 5MB to 30MB in space 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11285:	   Latest update won't allow me to view conversations. When I click "in reply to" previous tweets won't load. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11291:	   What kinda update it was? Its worse .. its not working not loading a profile after this update. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11294:	   this app is great. i like it a lot because it works similarly to tweetdeck for me; i can have my lists and users up in tabs. however my app crashes a lot!! especially when im in the midst of being very active! also it would be nice to include an option for not just a mentions tab but a notification tab in general so u can see faves and rt's of your tweets. one of my biggest pet peeves is when i click on the "in reply to" button to view previous tweets in a thread the tweets flash for a second then disappear 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11296:	   Cant choose profile to twit from, compose now doesnt work. Last update is bad, please fix otherwise excellent app! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11299:	   I simply loved the app in Kitkat, installed L preview recently and I'm having issues with it, not complaining but just leaving it here as the latest change log says temporary fix for L. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11300:	  I can't even get it to open since I've installed the latest update. Fix it please! This app used to be so good. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11301:	  I love the new font on the newest update. But fix the view conversation please. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11303:	   Newest update still crashes constantly on android L. Love the app though 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11304:	  Crashes instantly since the most recent update. 1 star until fixed... 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11312:	   Really nice and really love it, but need more update for fix some bug. Thank 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11315:	   I'm a dedicated Ubersocial user...but have been having some problems with it lately. I saw the reviews for this app and decided to try it. I've only used Twidere for a short time but like it already. Lots of customization options when it comes to look and feel, and the way tweets and images are displayed. I will be using this app exclusively so that I get to know it better. The app could use a few widgets - I like having my tweet feed displayed on one of my screens rather than having to open the app. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11323:	   Lost the ability to compose tweets (error 226) once I used the keys mentioned in the description link to get the activity tab. Worse, if I open a user and click on tweets to view their tweets, it doesn't load, even after refreshing the page. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11325:	   I'm having issues changing my profile picture. I also cannot seem to find a "Turn off retweets" option. Fantastic app, by the way! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11329:	   The view replies doesnt view any replies at all for a tweet. Please fix it. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11334:	   Highly customisable, and rather good with two main exceptions: Replies don't load for me, at all (Which is horribly annoying), and the notifications are a little slow to arrive. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11335:	   I can't get my timeline tweets to load? Tried everything on four phones. Is there something missing here? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11338:	   The stutter causes some issues with navigating. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11339:	   This is my favorite twitter client, it works how I want, and looks how I want it to look. One small bug I noticed is that it doesn't accurately display that I've read all messages or new tweets when I scroll down to the bottom of the page, other than that, first impressions of this app are very good, can't wait to use it more! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11353:	   Doesn't upload gifs 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11354:	   It runs a lot smoother than the official twitter app! And the color options are a lot nicer on the eyes. My only complaint is that there isn't a general area or tab for notifications. There's one for mentions, but I like to see when people like and retweet things. Also, when you click on the Home icon to refresh the feed, you still have to drag the page down to force-refresh it. Small issue, but it confused me at first. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11355:	  Liked it until it totally stopped working 3 days ago. Uninstalling. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11356:	   However, there's still a few bugs. Sometimes the "tap to load more" doesn't work/ doesn't appear. In further improvement, I hope that they will have sync functionality. I have few device, and sometimes upgrade to new devices. To customize all over again is quite a hassle. App wise, it is still better compare to other twitter base apps. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11358:	   On my phone everything is good till i noticed when i long press home button i got error. systemui has stopped. When i uninstall this app the problem gone. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11362:	  I like how you can edit the theme color and make the background transparent. The "keep the compose tweet open" option helps too. Also like how faving/retweeting takes a few buttons to press so no accidental faving. Unfortunately there seems to be some bugs, like userpic switching. I also don't like how it doesn't automatically refresh (even though I have the option ON) and I have to refresh manually. Overall, an OK app, would be great if they improve some parts. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11368:	   This is a very polished and thoughtfully-designed app. It's also open source and privacy-respecting. I greatly prefer it over Twitter's official app. A few SMALL issues: it doesn't handle all Twitter URLs from external apps reliably (maybe there's some issue with its URL matching?); it would be nice if there were a way to search for or jump to specific users' tweets/feeds more quickly; auto-loading images in tweets doesn't work for me at all. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11369:	   Really nice and sleek UI, lot of customization. Crashes a lot though. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11370:	   Amazing design, lots of settings, beautiful user interface. How you going to give all that then have one little notification switch that does not work. Im with others that's a deal break for sure. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11371:	   Literally the only thing this app needs in order to completely surpass the normal Twitter app is working notifications, only if it just vibrates, that'll be all it needs. If this app gets working notifications, I'll never go back to the normal Twitter app, but for now I'll have to leave this app again as I find that not having working notifications is just too big of a downside, even outweighing all of Twitter's bugs and problems. As soon as Twidere gets working notifications, I'll never go back to Twitter. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11374:	   I really wanted to like this app and for the most part I do. More than that actually, I love it...except notifications don't work. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling...I've changed every possible setting...I've reboot multiple times but to no avail... no notifications. Sorry, this is a deal breaker. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11379:	  Won't let me retweet, favourite and so on. Keeps saying their is an error and stops be doing so as a spam filter 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11386:	   Dear developer, this is the best looking twitter client ever. However, we need a url shortener when we are talking too much on a tweet.. please provide a feature like TWITLONGER in this app.. Also, there is a bug while viewing Picture from TWITPIC.. Please fix it soon! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11388:	   My problem is that I can't see other pictures (if there are two or more posted.) I also can't send photos in DM. And you should also let us follow people without going into their profiles directly (you know, like Twitter's). But other than that, the app's doing fine. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11389:	   Still no lag or bug, Tranparent theme! Anything seems good but sometimes stopped by itself and now find thats hard to search for account and after seeing someone tweet from his/her profile go back to homescreen ;) 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11391:	   Great app. Anyone know how to take pic from camera and post on the app? I cannot find a 'take pic' button only insert from gallery. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11394:	   PROS: customisable, beautiful interface, FAST even on slow networks, smooth, NO ADS, push notifications, easily manage lists/mutes. CONS: no way to view faves &RTs of own tweets (only mentions), viewing replies/conversations is clunky/confusing, gifs &vids (&some pics) won't load, no "near by" stream, only displays 1 # or @ at a time when typing, no schedule tweet feature, app size goes from 5 MB to 60 MB in space :( 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11396:	   With my android did not work properly 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11405:	   I really love this app but its keeps force closing n it causes my phone to freeze alot.. An update would be great cos i can't get to tweet really. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11419:	   Great app, browsing timeline is good, but notifications doesn't work at all 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11420:	  That is pity, that client do not download all stream even with stream plugin. Sometimes I have to 10-15 times press "tap to load " 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11423:	   But it cant open twitpic, maybe it's a bug. Please fix it 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11424:	   Such a gorgeous app. Unfortunately started to hog as much as 30% battery from the last few days. Also, strangely it showed a person's DP against someone else's tweet. But upon refreshing it would be fixed. Uninstalling for the moment. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11426:	   Crashes almost every time I switch to landscape mode. When trying to expand avatars they are still small. Needs to be able to watch instagram and vine videos in app. Needs update 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11428:	   Really liked the animations and also the personalization of the app, the only problem I had was that I cannot see any replies. Is there an option I'm missing? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11434:	   Photos with the pic.twitter domain do not display. I'd love to help report bug... 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11441:	   If you have two-factor authentication turned on, as everyone should, this app won't work for you. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11442:	   Light & fast app. Transitions are cool. Drafts, quotes, images, blocking.. everything yo. Swiping menu is smooth and entirely useful. Dark is my flavour. Multiple accounts with ease. Great work!! Very nice app. *List members won't delete* but I can add. Fix that and it's a 5 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11445:	   I emailed a problem to the developer and if has been 2 weeks and no response. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11446:	   I really like this app a lot. However it crashes when I try to update my profile pic. 5 starts when that bug is fixed. Other then that, solid. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11452:	   Pretty good, but why am I not getting notifications from faves/retweets? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11454:	   I love the customizability in the app and the custom tabs but there's two things that are quite frustrating about this app that takes it away from 5 stars. One being the constant rate limit exceeded message that pops up way too often, and the other more important one being that notifications simply do not work, if this worked It'd be 5 stars EASILY but I don't get them unless I've refreshed my homepage after I've opened the app or 30 minutes or even upwards to over an hour after a message has been received. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11457:	  Not getting my notifications. Why? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11459:	   But it has a bug while uploading pictures.... please fix it. Thanks! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11464:	   The customization is so good! I really like the swipe to close feature as well, but if it's enabled it creates a delay when opening tweets. Hopefully that gets fixed soon 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11470:	   Image fail to load, it says error read only 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11476:	   This seems like a lovely app, but it won't let me post pictures (I get an error message and the tweet is saved to drafts). Waited a few weeks, hoping for an update, but nothing has happened. Also, it's frustrating trying to access the page of a user through their retweets. It should be a 1-click process, but it's not even an option. Uninstalling. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11478:	   I started using this app today and eventually i removed official twitter app. But there are some lacks, one of them is the notification issue. Fix this problem then i'll give 5 stars. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11484:	  notificatin do not work! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11486:	   I really love this app. But whenever I want to send a pic it says "Tweet not sent, and saved to drafts" So I always try to resend it but it won't resend. PLEASE FIX! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11488:	   I don't get my notifs but I don't really mind that. I just hope the trends could be changed based on location. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11503:	   Completely customizable, really fast, never crashes. If I could give this six stars I'd give it seven! So grateful for this lovely app! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11520:	    api error wtf 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11522:	   Twidere is my favorite Twitter app now. I would've have it 5 stars, but I didn't because it's missing a few things. If Twidere added more detailed notifications to it's @ mentions notifications it would be better. Like if it could start telling you, who followed you, how many people Rt'd you & who Rt'd you like in the regular Twitter app, they have that feature. Another is, if you could customize the back ground yourself, like if it gave you the option to take a picture from your gallery. That's all. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11524:	   This app is a huge success. It does everything you might need to do with twitter and it does it really fast. It has a great UI, simple and beautiful! It's been a long time I'm using this app and I don't remember having a problem with any of its countless features. everything works like a charm. I just want to say a big thanks to its developers! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11533:	  Decent enough layout but the notifications do not work. I literally get them hours after the fact if at all. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11534:	   I used to be a happy user of Tweetcaster, but after many crashes I looked for a new alternative. Suddenly I found Twidere and and my phone is happier than ever :) 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11538:	   With the death of TweetDeck, I'm left looking for a replacement, and this comes the closest, and even outperforms in some areas. Better than any and everything else I can find on Play, and the pricing can't be beat. Few bugs, and missing features, but one can always hope this will continue to see development. **Edit (30MAR14)** Boosted score to 5 stars: Although not following any regular schedule, Twidere is being updated with reasonable frequency. The most irksome bug has been long since patched out, and I am quite pleased with the current iteration. I have used this app exclusively for several months now, and intend to continue to do so. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11547:	   Swiping from tab to tab isn't smooth at all. Sometimes I swipe and the app tries to refresh my timeline. Fix? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11549:	  I tried to sign in like 15 different times and it keeps saying error while signing in error 401. Tried signing in with my sister's twitter and it worked fine. Why won't it let me sign in? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11550:	   Yeahhhh, finally I get replacement for Twicca since I can't run Twicca in my K900 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11552:	   I like it. It's smooth. It is nice to look at. Easily one of the best interfaces of any twitter app. Only problems I have are that it's difficult to see who follows you when you open a profile as it's not clear and obvious. It's also inconvenient that it doesn't auto complete twitter handles and most hash tags like my other 2 twitter clients. Fix those, this is easily 5 stars. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11564:	   Used to work fine but lately has been crashing or freezing to the point that its unusable. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11569:	   I agree with the guys below. Problem with tab. Had to uninstall. Not easy to use 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11571:	   This app is really good. It has a great design and it is of great functionality. If only it wouldn't crash all the time.. I'd be lucky if this problem got solved, I love this client so much! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11572:	   Great app but have noticed it does crash more than other Twitter apps. Still great and highly recommended 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11585:	   But there is still a bug, if I see "view replies" there is no written replies, there should be replies, hopefully for the better :) 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11591:	   I keep receiving a error message when I try to change my profile pic. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11594:	   A great app if you're looking for something highly customizable yet fast and sleek. However, the only concern I have is that I can't get the activity tab even after changing the consumer key/secret. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11595:	   5 "but" I couldn't find setting for LOCAL TRENDS and I can't seem to acces ACTIVITY TAB even if I changed consumer key/secret. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11598:	   Only thing that I would add is the ability to see who has favourited your tweets and get notifications from them, and be able to toggle the ability to do so. Maybe have a favourites tab that isn't just tweets that you have favourited. Otherwise, beautiful app, works lovely. **EDIT** This app DID work lovely until the side menu stopped registering anything. Couldnt select anything or go into settings, menu key woukdnt work. Not my phones problem because these keys were registering outside of the app. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11602:	   It's kinda like a cool twitter app . It's design with simple colours , everything is fine to me . But it's just crash all the time . Sometimes it can't even open the twidere . If you can fix this it will be great . But i guarantee that this app is super cool . Like the way it slide at the side :) great ! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11606:	   It's a beautiful app. Although I have to take a star of for various reasons. 1: the amount of memory it takes is crazy. You should build it with the memory optimization tweaks for KitKat. 2: can't get push notifications. 3: I understand the rate limit but it's just so much more aggressive on this compared to other apps. Meaning the way this handles refreshing could use a bit tweaking 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11611:	   If you're looking for a speedy, high-quality Twitter client with a vast array of functions and capabilities and a clean, attractive interface, LOOK NO FURTHER! Twidere is without the shadow of a doubt the best you can get! I've tried at least seven different Twitter apps, including the official one, but none come close to this one in terms of features and functionality. I've given the app five stars because it really is undeniably FANTASTIC, but I do have a few suggestions I'd like to make: 1) Crashing: This app actually crashes a LOT for me. I have a Galaxy SIII; I don't know if it's my phone or the app, but hopefully it's something that can be fixed either way. 2) Notifications for specific users: Sometimes you follow a celebrity or company or organization whose Tweets you don't want to miss. The official Twitter app gives you the ability to favorite a profile so that whenever they tweet, you get a notification. This might be a good feature to add! As I said before, however, all things considered, this app is literally the best. I only have those two small complaints, but they're not unbearable issues. I'm looking forward to updates and improvements! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11613:	   My biggest issue with this app is that I cannot choose my image upload preference. Is there a way to set it up that I've missed? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11615:	   Suddenly i lost all my direct message history. Please fix this and you'll get five stars 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11621:	   I like it just freezes up a lot but that can be fixed. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11623:	   Just little question here. Why we can't save the image from what people posted? Could you please adding that feature to your app? Thanks. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11625:	   Sluggish at times. Bugs here and there like not being able to click on the options in the sidebar, tweets having wrong timestamp, number at home icon will remain after refreshing. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11634:	   The streaming service is amazing! Can't find it on any other client 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11643:	   Bug fixed. Save images option. Thanks! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11646:	   Amazing app. Customizable and intuitive UI. Smooth and Holo UI. Must have for twitter addicts. Edit: I am not really finding it very stable. Its beta so I won't blame it. Reported a few issues. Hoping future updates will solve the problem. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11647:	   simply the best. yet this is still beta version. great job, dev! just one problem here, whenever I refresh the timeline, only load 20 new tweets. is there an option to add more new tweets (100/200) just like Tweetcaster? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11659:	   Still having bug when open mention conversation. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11660:	   I dont know it's bug or what, but when i tap "load more tweet" the timeline will scrolling up til the middle new timeline, so if i want to read old tweet...i must scroll down the timeline...its really annoying. And that's happen too when i tap "load more..." then i'm quit from the app and back to app again...the timeline will go up to the newest tweet. Fyi i choose "remember position" already and uncheck all in the "refresh" (i didnt use auto refresh and all in the menu) Xperia L jellybean 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11663:	   I cant setting. when i wanna set any setting in this app it's crash all the time. but very pretty twitter app. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11664:	   Works great until latest major upgrade. Mentions background update doesn't work. DM works however. Yes the app is enabled to send notification for mentions. Not using power saving. Service verified as running. On Vzw gs4. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11665:	   Giving 5 stars because it's great but since last night it has been crashing when trying to send a new tweet or reply. Hope it gets resolved soon 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11666:	   I found an issue. My twidere stop notify me whenever i've got a new mention so i should refresh it manually. Do you know what is wrong with that? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11687:	   This is now the best twitter app I've used....only problem widget is not working, crashes before opening 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11694:	   still having issues. cannot view profile. keeps on force close. also, have to unselect one account whenever want to compose. why? fix please. i'm attached to this app. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11695:	   I am not in position to give even 1 star to this f*** app. You even can't find people on search!!! Work on it please. Uninstalling 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11706:	   Finally a good looking, minimal Twitter client that's fast and easy to use. Only downside at the moment would be the auto-update of the timeline not working properly (when opening the app). Hopefully something that'll be fixed soon :) 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11712:	   i really really love this app. but it take a long time to search some user or someone tweet, and if i want to see someone (or my) ava it keep said "error data invalid" if you can fix that i'll give 5stars!:) 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11715:	   Keeps crashing 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11720:	   Awesome app best 3rd party app for Twitter :) keep it up. It's just little bit slow and cant open images of other profile pics, in next update fix that. :) 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11727:	   The loading time is too slow. Seems a bit laggy too. Doesn't save tweet position. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11729:	   When I go to my profile to see my tweets, it takes too long! Please fix... 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11740:	   It always says unable to refresh mention and timeline, thought my connection is HSDPA. This is a great app but please fix it 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11741:	   I have downloaded most of twitter clients in playstore. They all wrapped with a bunch of annoying ads, or not good interface. Then I came to this app. This is perfect, all I want is in this app. And no ad, I really respect you guys for no ad at all. I love the interface, and all. The only thing that is inconvenient is the notifications came late and not vibrating even though I set it to vibrate. If you could fix it, this is the most perfect twitter app. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11742:	  NO Profile Pics, No Image Previews. CAN'T UPLOAD PICS. What's this app for, btw??? 100% USELESS!!!! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11747:	   I love the customization options of the app. However, the app suffers from significant screen lag, scrolling lag, and keyboard input after about 30mins of use. I do not know if it is my HTC One specifically, or perhaps performance issues of the app itself. Perhaps this can be addressed in a future update. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11748:	   It's kinda annoying because it took a very loooong time to load user's tweets, followings & followers. Please fix it, and it'll be the best twitter client ever! :D 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11757:	   Strongly recommend! but , the app went to crash and stop working, although it would recover automatically. Or it's perfect. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11759:	   Perfectly great app! I love this! It reminds me about rainmeter SAO. It's very great! A little more great update and it'll be perfect. Fix some bugs. Arigatou!~ 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11767:	   I still can't uploading a photo. The notification is tweet not sent. So, the tweet save in the draft.please fix it. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11775:	   I'm a quite picky twitter user, I always look at how an app looks, can see via, have twitlonger, can translate and can see trending topic. Twidere is basic but powerful, you just need to find out. You also can use twicca plugins in this app. But one thing I wish will be better - the quote tweet tool. Although it quotes the tweet, it is still a reply. Please fix it to work like the old retweet. Thank you. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11783:	   Since the last update the app just force closes as soon as you open it on both my nexus 7 and my Nexus S. Will update review once fixed. [UPDATE:] clearing the app's cache as suggested by the dev has fixed the problem. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11785:	   Everything seems to be working fine except notifications and custom tabs. Custom tabs is always blank and I am not getting any notifications 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11791:	   Twitter Jail Or Rate Limit Problem How To Remove That Please Help Or Update It 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11793:	  Does not work. Tried both direct and web logon options. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11794:	    but need more fixes. make it load faster and fix the bugs.  though 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11801:	    The only problem is the rate limit :( which as the developer says, there's nothing to do about it.. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11807:	   Apps is not bad but then notification is abit not very good. I don't get notification recently and when people favourite my Tweet is not show on the mention. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11814:	   I love this app. But one problem is about its notifications. It does not notify me even if there is a new mentions and even if i hv set it to notify me. Please fix this. Then, i can give it a 5 star. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11819:	   Sure it's sound stupid, but believe me there will be more user by doing that. Just make a developer's choice check box to turn off application error notices. Anyway still very nice work. I switch from twicca from time to time to use this app. Really like the 'activity about me' tab. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11823:	  I can't find the trends... 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11824:	   Sorry - this program is compromised. Don't download or use it, it send a whole bunch of spam DMs. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11830:	   I can't change my avatar. After selecting a photo, it become freezing, and I can't save my changes. But overall it's good twitter client. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11846:	   Why? Says 'not trusted server'. Please fix that 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11849:	   Love this app! But the latest update makes the app always force close when i want to see the picture in timeline or open a link and the profile pic are not clear. Please fix it. I'll wait for next update :D 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11857:	   Clean UI, customizable color tabs to keep track of favorite tweeters, smooth scrolling, & lots of other customizations. Would like the option of twitlonger though. **EDIT: FORCE CLOSE MANY TIMES WHEN TRYING TO VIEW MINE & OTHER USER'S TWEETS PAGE (custom tabs). Will give 5* when this is fixed. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11859:	   si no fuera por un bug con los mensajes directos seria excelente! espero actualizacion! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11864:	   It crashes on change and doesn't save it. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11865:	   Update : uploading photos error. Update : why do pictures seem small when viewed? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11866:	   Favorites Tweets shows wrong counts, please fix 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11868:	   i just saw this app on my play store today and downloaded it because i haven't tried it. and after i signed in to my twitter account i was impressed. the clean simple design and the ability to reply on multiple tweets just exactly what i need. however, i can't find my custom tabs. I don't know where it was placed. i assumed it would be on the top along with the other tabs, but it wasn't there. so i deleted it again. when i tried to add favorites tab, the tab was there. but i couldn't refresh tweets that i've favorited. other than that, i haven't found any problems with this app. i think it could be one mighty twitter client. oh.. one more thing.. i couldn't see any conversation option. (or is it only me who couldn't find 'see conversation' option?) - 24 Nov: now i can see the "pull to see conversation" option. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11869:	   Very good client, only issue is after switching accounts (untick one account, retick another) , selected account for posting doesn't change with it. I prefer to manage one account at a time, so this is a bit of a loss... 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11883:	   I always look for efficient interface in an app, and so far this is app is it, lpoks neat, simple, holo-y and also fast due to the ability to turn off profile image and inline image preview, and also the dual pane layout us beautiful. Rivals most paid client I've used. Unfortunately I'm running into connection problems several times, and have to clear data to fix it. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11892:	   Unable to view tweets, constant authentication errors. No info how to fix this. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11894:	   Ever since I updated, it's saying "Unknown error message" Other than this app is perfect! Open source ftw! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11895:	   Fix how to get rid limit for refreshing timeline. It might be the great twitter client then. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11896:	   Can you add a twitlonger and fix the refresh 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11898:	   once you fix the notification it will do me good~ 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11899:	   Other than the rate limit (which is NOT the devs fault) this is an excellent twitter client. Five stars if the repeat notification problem is fixed. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11912:	   It is always saying "Error88 Rate limit exceeded!" what does that mean? please fix that.. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11914:	   what's error 88? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11922:	   I loved this app so much, but after the last update my TL won't update, it crashes constantly & error messages come up all the time. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11923:	   "Error: Cannot Get Authenticity Token." What's that? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11925:	   It's nice! I love this app! but yesterday I can't open Twidere. It's always ask me to force close. please fix it! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11927:	   I would give it 5 stars if we could view trending topics & my tl doesn't refresh always. It says "error 130 over capacity" 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11928:	   list timeline shows nothing, stopped working after update, shows empty timeline, how can i fix? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11929:	   Make the default tabs cutomize-able. Getting errors on mention with the latest version. Fix these and i'll give u 5 stars! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11930:	  Stopped working after the latest update 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11947:	   I like this app. but if u can add the ability to write tweets directly in the hash tags coz I couldn't find a way to do it! Also, if you add the ability to show a thumbnail for youtube vids in tweets it will be perfect! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11965:	   needs fix on remember timeline position. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11968:	   overall it is a good twitter client, but when i try to change my consumer key and consumer secret it always get an error with oauth.. what should i do with it? 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11969:	  good app but more update pls and pls fix the app its force close so insane:( 
org.mariotaku.twidere#11997:	   I've been trying to log in for days and it still doesn't work.... It takes me to the page were you authorize the app when I press sign in, I type in my info & then it takes me back to the sign in sign up page for twidere... /: 
org.mariotaku.twidere#12010:	   Seems to nail features most clients don't but it seems to have issues using oAuth on my GTab 10.1 and scrolling is sluggish on my GNex. Keep an eye on this one! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#12016:	   Doesn't remember position in the list and doesn't open tweet gaps from bottom which are essential to me. A shame as it had a great UI. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#12018:	   Problems with position remembering. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#12025:	   I like the new look on the Nexus 7. Scrolling is still an issue, but only in portrait. In land scape, even with photos on Nexus 7 scrolling is super smooth. Just make it super smooth in portrait and I will be all happy and give 5 stars. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#12029:	   Looks awesome and I read good things about it but I can't use it can't sign in 
org.mariotaku.twidere#12030:	   The UI is superb! I would like to see an optional fixed single column mode on portrait mode. This app is fantastic though. Cheers! 
org.mariotaku.twidere#12034:	   This is a great Twitter app. First time I tried it there was no fully black background so didn't use it, now there is an option for solid black for AMOLED screens, which simply looks awesome and sexy on the GNex. Needs option to choose photo upload service, TwitLonger, also needs to be smoother in scrolling. But otherwise a very nice looking app, thanks to the Holo UI. 
org.mariotaku.twidere#12038:	   Works even better after the bug fixes. But please bring back dual pane view for tablets in portrait mode! If you wanted to remove it then make it a configurable option instead - I thought it was a better implementation than Plume and would give 5 stars if you brought it back!
