com.kmagic.solitaire#110000:	  Does not fit screen, clicks are off. Samsung galaxy note 5. No option to get to menu. Please fix, still having problems. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110002:	  Been using this app for 10 year or more and love it, but.....reset my mobile to factory defaults on my OnePlus 3 Android 7 and Oxygen OS last night and now the settings do not work. All I can do is open and close the app and play. Pity. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110007:	  Used to be great but can't access menu now on new phones. Shame 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110013:	  Loved the game, then my phone updated from Android 5 to Android 6 about a year ago. Hasn't worked since then. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling it but it just won't work. Liked it so much I kept it on here in hopes it would get fixed but uninstalled it today since it just doesn't work any longer. Wish it did. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110015:	  Doesn't work for S7. This was the only solitaire game I liked on here. Bummer 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110016:	  Game can't be played on Edge 7. Doesn't fill the screen up like it used to. Please fix this. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110020:	    for Samsung se7. Will only work once you download it but when you close the app it does not work right again 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110023:	   I have loved this app for years and have had no problems even with upgraded phones and tablets, but now with my new Asus tablet Android 6.0.1, it didn't work. The graphics were blurry and the menu was missing so I was unable to do anything including being able to exit. I had to uninstall it. I will give 5 stars again if this issue is fixed. I miss this app. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110024:	  In my redmi 3s prime, i didnot have toolbar from where i can change my game or undo my moves.resolve the issue, 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110025:	   I played this game all the time. Best out there. I had to upgrade my phone to a Galaxy S7 edge. Now the app is useless. It runs small, 1/2 screen, no controls as before, unable to change games. Until they fix this app STAY AWAY it doesn't work. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110028:	  Couldn't access a new game 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110030:	   Screen keeps shrinking with no way to pull up the menu or fix it. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110032:	   I relaxed by playing this...often. now I can't. Phone updated OS and now no longer works. Screen about 1/2 size. No longer can move cards. No access to menu screen. Non responsive to movement. Needs an update. SUCKS 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110034:	   This app has not been updated since December 2010. Since it was designed for older versions of Android, the menu might not work on your phone. The graphics were designed for the lower resolution screens of older phones and will not look as good on the newer, higher resolution phones. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110046:	  Great solitaire app but doesn't work on Nexus 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110055:	   I loved this on my old ZTE phone. In my new Samsung phone you can't get to the menu to select a different game, the options, or stats. Uninstalled. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110056:	   Great game have played more than 5000 hands over the years. but now that I got the galaxy s7 I'm having the same problem as an earlier comment. it's not filling the screen and no menu what so ever. Please fix it would love to continue using this game. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110057:	   You cannot get the whole screen or the options to change or start a new game. Extremely sad, as this is my favorite game, my stress relief. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110059:	   NOT ANY MORE!! IT DOES NOT WORK WITH THE GALAXY S6.. I've tried many ways to get it to work right & it only shows 1/2 the screen, can't move cards, no menu to even start games - let a lone customize:( 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110064:	   As the title says, the app GUI has serious problems on this phone. The size and coordinate system are not set up right, probability a pixel density problem. There's also no way to get to the menu. Worked great on my S5 though! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110065:	   Takes up virtually no space, no ads, never had a problem 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110067:	   I played this for years on an old phone with a menu button and loved it, but my new phone doesn't have a menu button so this doesn't work. Besides, it gets confused with higher resolution so that touch areas don't correspond with card images. DESPERATELY needs updating! Three games, no ads this app was great, now it's lame! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110068:	  I love this game. But it needs to be updated to keep with newer phones. The screen size shrunk and i cant read whats in the bottom corner because its all black. There is no way to access the menu screen. Please fix this otherwise your game will become unplayable. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110071:	  I can't get to the menu at all, super bummed I used to love this app 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110072:	   I thought it wouldn't work with the Galaxy S7, but the only change was having to use the "Back" key rather than the "Stack" key on the home screen. You still tap it to go back one card. Just lay your finger on the key. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110074:	  This used to be a great solitaire app, it didn't require permissions, wasn't a battery drain, and didn't have ads. And it still has all those benefits, but a lot of new phones don't have the "menu" button this app needs to access the menu/settings so it is unfortunately unusable now. Would love to see an update to fix this. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110075:	   I've been playing this game literally since I got my first smartphone back in 2011. Now it's blurry and there is no menu!! What gives?? I want my Solitaire back! Uninstalled until FIXED... and it's not like tons of other Note 5 users haven't already told you about the issue. SMFH 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110078:	   Will not work on my gal 7. I loaded it 2 times. Still the same. Only part screen and no controlling 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110079:	   Before the firmware update this was my favorite. But now it doesn't fill the screen, the touch and screen are not matched, and I can't access the menu. I hope this gets updated. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110080:	   Just switched from Samsung Grand Prime to a Samsung J7. Had an in game menu button on old phone but not on my new one. If fixed 5 star rating. Have had this app on all of my phone's. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110081:	   It worked great on my old Samsung Galaxy 5 but stalls, has a shrunk screen and cannot open menu on my 7. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110082:	   Changed phone from Galaxy S3 to S7. Graphics don't fit any more, menu items don't appear and freecell no longer available. Was told it was fixed. Still no freecell (which is the only game I played) and graphics don't fit screen. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110087:	    in a game and couldn't get out. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110090:	   Using this app for over 4 years. Works great. Update: My LG G5 does not have a menu button and I can't access other games. I can't even start a new game. Please update. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110094:	   Great app! Only issue is that after I upgraded to galaxy 7 I don't have a menu button to access other games. And the only one I played was forty thieves.  and now I can't get to it. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110100:	  Don't work tried to Uninstall and reinstall but does nothing won't work. I give it negative stars if I could. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110105:	   It malfunctioning can't get it to play full screen 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110109:	  After last update on Samsung Galaxy S6, app stopped working all together. Uninstalling then installing again will only let me play 1 or 2 games before it quits again. Used to be my favorite game, but not anymore. Don't seems like the KM folks want to fix it. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110110:	   To fix the 1/2 screen, in phone settings, "display", "display scaling" change to "condensed" restart phone, then change back to "standard" and restart. I don't know why, but it worked for me please "thumbs up" if it worked for you. To get the "game menu" hold the "back" button for 3-5 seconds. It worked yesterday, but not today :( 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110111:	   I used to really love to play this game but every since I got my Samsung Galaxy S7 this app does not work right on it!! Please fix this issue!! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110113:	   Ive had this app on a number of phones now & it was always the first thing i installed. Unfortunately my current phone (an LG) doesn't have anyway for me to access the app menu, so i cant save, cant access settings, cant even deal a new game. Needs fixing asap. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110114:	   Great time killing game. Easy to use & never experienced bugs during gameplay in the years & 10000+ games I have played on various devices. Two things to fix: 1st, spider game, needs an on screen way to deal the deck. Can't without trackball or search key. Maybe make it so swiping across the top of the screen? 2nd, I haven't surrendered a freecell game in thousands of games, I'm careful to not leave it open or other ways it falsely registers a loss, but stats keep showing losses I haven't incurred. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110116:	   Pure simple app, great....... free game with no ads.... Just a shame it doesn't run on marshmallow. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110118:	   I'll update this to 5 stars if they fix this to work with the Android 6.0 update. Right now it doesn't fit the screen and the cards are off kilter because of it. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110124:	   I love this app but won't work on new phones please fix it 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110127:	   I like this app good game. But up graded from note 2 to note 4, now it doesn't work. No in game menu.

com.kmagic.solitaire#110152:	   Works great on S2 - S5 but can't access the menu on the S6 and newer Samsung phones :-( Still no update!!!! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110154:	   Spider doesn't have any way of dealing cards. What phones have trackballs anymore? Contacted developer and never heard anything. I don't think there's been any updates on this app for quote some time. I wish the developer would fox the spider issue. It says you can tap the deck, but there is no deck to tap. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110158:	   No ads! But stopped working right with marshmallow update 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110159:	   It shrinks down to a small size and won't move. I've tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it and it just doesn't work. It might work for one or two games, then it locks up. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110160:	   Used to work. Now it don't work for crap on the Galaxy S7 Edge! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110161:	   I had this app on my Samsung Tab 3 & Galaxy Note 4. Absolutely loved it! It's simple, very entertaining, and not loaded with adware! It was wonderful. I say"was" for after my Galaxy Note 4 updated the operating system, it would no longer operate at full screen and the menu bar would not appear. PLEASE fix this issue!

com.kmagic.solitaire#110171:	   I love this app on my tablet, however on my old note5 and now on my S7, it's not full screen and the touch calibration is off. Please fix...Update: now I have a note 7, it's full screen again yea! But when I try to access the menu, I have to click and hold on the recent apps button. That button also accesses the split screen view. It won't open the menu. Therefore I've only played one game and cannot start another! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110173:	  It works fine on my ZTE ZMAX, button the ZMAX Pro I can't get a new game, make options. Just fix it. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110176:	   Pls fix. My favorite app for solitaire. Was working fine until last week.

com.kmagic.solitaire#110213:	   Long time player, but in the last several days the app is fuzzy, shrunk and is non responsive. Same device and provider. Resetting hasn't worked. Tried many other apps over the years, and they just haven't been as simple to play or challenging. Please fix!!!

com.kmagic.solitaire#110224:	  Please fix spider for Lollipop. I can't access the menu buttons. I cant switch games. This game needs an update for the newer operating systems. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110225:	   This game is the only advertising free version of solitaire that I have been able to find on the Android market. It always ran perfectly on my HTC Evo & HTC One, but on my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, the application opens up in only 2/3 of the screen, and really doesn't work. Sadly, I have to uninstall.

com.kmagic.solitaire#110240:	  Please fix it so that it works on my Verizon Note Edge. I've used this app for probably 6 years, since I had the original Droid, and it no longer works on the Marshmallow 6.0 update. Otherwise, I totally love this app!

com.kmagic.solitaire#110264:	   Great app but, that was on my EVO. Now that I have the new DNA by HTC it seems to chug just a bit. I think it needs to be optimized for a hi def (true 1080 - 441ppi (totally awsome)) screen. Now, 2 years later I have a galaxy note 4. Looks and responds great. Update 07/18/16: Got the marshmallow update and the game wants to open at 1/4 screen size but drags cards as though it were full screen. Basically it doesn't work anymore. Needs to be updated. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110272:	  Not working on Marshmallow. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110273:	   I've played this game for years and love it. Now the menu button has disappeared and can't play anymore, sadly. I'll keep checking back and modify my rating when fixed.

com.kmagic.solitaire#110301:	   1st Review - I've been playing your games for many YEARS now. This was my FAVORITE set of solitaire games until last week when my Samsung Galaxy S 6 was updated from Lollipop to Marshmallow. Now I can't play any of the games at all! The screen has shrunk by half, the direction/new game button has disappeared and nothing responds. Please, please fix this, I'm really missing playing. No other Solitaire even comes close.

com.kmagic.solitaire#110303:	   This was my favorite solitaire game until my phone updated to Android marshmallow. Now it won't work at all. Had to delete it in favor of other solitaire game which I don't like half as much. Please fix it!!!

com.kmagic.solitaire#110343:	   If you don't mind not being able to play Spider, this app is fun. I play Forty Thieves for at least an hour every day. Still frustrated about the Spider deal problems though. I don't have a search button or any other buttons on my phone (galaxy note), so the entire game is useless, which sucks because I like spider solitaire. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110345:	  Loved it until about 1hr ago I did the phone update. It screwed up my game. I will uninstall this and reinstall. Hopefully that will fix it. Can no longer play Forty Thieves 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110350:	  Not working with Samsung Note 4 after latest update. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110353:	   Update for Note 5: I've had multiple phones over the past few years and always come back to this app. I love it. Unfortunately, there has been no support for this app in some time, and when I was forced to upgrade because my old phone died, I realized that the app doesn't work on the new phone. I haven't bothered to install another program, because I don't enjoy any other app like I do this one. PLEASE UPDATE FOR NEWER ANDROID MARKET! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110355:	   I used this app, and really enjoyed it for several years, but when I installed it on my new Samsung Galaxy 7, the cards are tiny. I can't even read the numbers and have found no options to fix it. Very weird. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110356:	  Does not work with Android 6 Marshmallow as app only uses part of the screen & locks up after 1 or 2 screen presses 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110358:	   Do not work with S7 no menu options does not fill the screan

com.kmagic.solitaire#110361:	   Doesn't work anymore 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110363:	   You guys must have fixed whatever was causing the issues I was experiencing, so everything works now. I'm back to enjoying playing free cell while taking my break upon the porcelain throne. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110364:	  Can't get to the menu on my HTC10. loved the game on my last two phones.

com.kmagic.solitaire#110389:	   I only get 3 of the solitaire games for choices. I can't deal next card row for spider solitaire -no options are present. I can bet that nobody is going to fix this. You just take our money and run. So f?ck you and your game. Assholes. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110390:	  Works on my phone. Does not work on my tablet, as accessing options requires a menu button. Many tabs do not have this. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110392:	   Works on the Turbo2 phone we have, only partially works on a Samsung S6. It doesn't fill the screen and has no access to the menu. Played it hundreds of times on all other phones we've had with no problem. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110395:	   This app has been terrific and has worked trouble free for years on several different phones. I got a new Samsung Galaxy S7 and i can't get it to work. It appears to be an issue with the display resolution. I can't access the menu and the display only appears on 2/3 of the screen. Can you please fix. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110397:	   I have been using this version for many years, but it doesn't work with my new phone. I've tried 10 other solitaire game with the new phone and don't like any of them.

com.kmagic.solitaire#110412:	   I have used this for years and rated it a five but, since an an update it does not work properly. Partial screen, cannot access menu and calibration is off.

com.kmagic.solitaire#110414:	   I love playing forty thieves but with the new OS it doesn't work. . 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110417:	  The game worked very well until a recent OS update for the Samsung Note4 caused the game to "minimize" on screen and essentially become unplayable. If it could be fixed, then I can rate it higher.

com.kmagic.solitaire#110443:	   I got a recent android update to my s6 and now the game is messed up. It has horrible resolution and cuts off the screen on the bottom and right side. Can't press the options button because it was in the missing corner. Please fix! I like this solitaire app the best

com.kmagic.solitaire#110488:	  I've had and loved this app for years but it won't work properly on my s7 edge please help. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110489:	   No ads, simple no thrills the best...edit, got new Galaxy S7, unfortunately app is not working well. Actually working terrible, needs update from Ken Magic. Otherwise, it was hands down the best solitare game out there 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110493:	   It does not work properly anymore. I had to do the android update and it is no longer compatible. The button the start a new game is missing and it only takes up 1/2 of my screen. I will keep trying to install the app and hope it works soon. This one was the best 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110494:	   So I have loved this app for years and am addicted to playing solitaire. It helps my anxiety. I have never had an issue with the app until tonight. I downloaded the new android update to my Galaxy Note 4 and now I am having an issue. When I open the app it is not full screen and I have no idea how to access my options or start a new game. Im so confused. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110496:	   I love this game. But, when my phone updated to the newest Android the game stopped working. I've reinstalled it and nothing. Game wont fit to screen or show options to play a new game. Can't move cards. Please fix this and I'll change my rating to 5 stars. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110498:	   No longer works under 6.0.1. Screen messed up and menu bottom does not work for Samsung Note 4. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110501:	   Samsung tab s2. Didn't fit the screen and was out of focus. ???? Reinstalled and tried again several weeks later still didn't work. Really crappie. Worked well on my old Asus tablet. Uninstalled. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110502:	   I simply love the app good job. The only problem is on your spider solitaire, I gues it needs some revision 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110503:	   I loved this on my s5. but on the new s7 the screen is dysfunctional. Completely unplayable until fixed. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110504:	   I love this game, but since upgrading from an S4 to an S5 it doesn't work due to different button configuration. Would be great if you could find a way to fix. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110507:	   With the new Android update, I can't get to the menu, the card surface is shrunk with black going along the left side and bottom. This has been my favorite 40 thieves until this came along. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110511:	   Won't work anymore with system update. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110515:	  I've had this app a long time and love it! I am unable to use it at all right now tho, glitch? Appears small and no menu button, can't use the phones. Please help!! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110516:	   Have played for years, got a new phone and it doesn't work, like other users have said. Now, why won't they get back to anyone or even look onto the issue? 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110517:	   Will not work on my Galaxy S7. No menus and screen is small and fuzzy. Locks up often. Hope it gets fixed, so I can keep using it. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110519:	  Don't work on my galaxy s7 :-( 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110525:	   The game work fine on anything below Android 5.1. The menus are no longer accessible via the soft key so you can't access new games or settings. It's a shame since this is the only free solitaire app I can find without ads. And I like the way it operates better than any others out there. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110536:	   Have been playing this for years but disappointed to find it doesn't work properly on S7...only half screen and no menu button 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110540:	   I have had this app for many years on all my smartphones, but it seems to be having issues on the Galaxy s7. Hope there is an update soon. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110541:	   I have enjoyed using this solitaire app for many years now - it's one of the best! Unfortunately, it doesn't work on my Galaxy S7. Please update the software!! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110543:	   Cannot access menu to restart or change games on galaxy s7. Loved this game until it didn't work on new phone. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110547:	  Man this was the best app ever but does not work on my galaxy 6 edge plus. Any suggestions? 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110548:	   Played this game for forty thieves only. Loved it on my nexus, but upgraded to Samsung phone. Now game is only half screen, no menu, stuck on regular solitaire. Bad graphics too. Since I can't use the app, will have to remove game unless fixed. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110550:	   Doesn't work correctly on Galaxy S7 Edge running Android 6.0.1. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110551:	  Used to be 5 star. Now I can't use it at all. Just got S7 Edge. Board is tiny, but the really bad thing is that the "Recent" button no longer gets you into Settings. Holding it down just gets a message about split screen not being available for this app. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110556:	  I loved this app but it's is unplayable on Galaxy 6 unless you uninstall and reinstall every time. I wasnt going to comment here and I emailed directly: but on the website there are many similar issues logged. All medium priorty and going back to much older model phones. It seems 'medium' priority is no priority at all :( 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110559:	  Sir not working on Samsung Note 5 handset. Please do needful & send updates for the same. Thanks. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110563:	   Would give 5 stars, but it completely crashes on my galaxy s6. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110564:	   Love this game and app, but ever since my phone updated it hasn't worked for me. So frustrating. Please update the app to work for me and others who are experiencing the same issue. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110566:	   It's not in HD, it comes frozen, the menus don't work, locked in landscape, can't do anything to play, and the art stinks. A fail at every level. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110570:	   Now it won't work correctly on my s6. Please please please fix. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110572:	  Can't find the way to change games. I had this for a few yrs then I got a new phone and can't find the way to switch it to freecell 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110574:	   I've used this app on 4 phones but my galaxy s6 can't play it. The menu won't open 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110575:	   I loved this game - no obtrusive ads and simple screen - but I just upgraded phones and now have no search button or trackpad. (Only back, home, and menu - Moto X Pure.) Now there is no way to deal cards. Please fix, and I will bump up my recommendation to the best on the market! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110576:	   I had this on a Samsung phone and loved it. Changed to an ASUS ZenFone and now I can't access any of the controls. I can't change games or even reset solitude. No info anywhere. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110584:	   The app is freezing up and it will not move at all. Started today. Please fix asap. Thanks! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110587:	   But I can't access a menu from my new android phone (Samsung S5). I've tried other solitaire games & this is the only one I like. Please put on a menu option for me 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110590:	   Does not work on my galaxy s6 anymore. I've played several thousand games on this app, but an update on my phone broke the game. Still no fix after two months... 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110591:	   I used to only use this game, but I can't find the menu on this phone??? 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110593:	   I have the same issues as others I think. I went from an S4 to a note 5. The layer doesn't have a menu key as my previous phone did. Most of the spots I reloaded have move the menu from the button to the actual screen input. Please update add I play forty thrives all the time and this app is the only one that gets out right. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110594:	   Nothing to complain about. Simple, clean, solitaire game. Kudos for no ads, no p2w, and no network access or other excessive permissions that plague mobile gaming. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110597:	   Loved this on my last Samsung Galaxy S4, now only fills part screen on G6 edge. Please fix, best available. Giving 5 stars in anticipation! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110598:	   It used to work on my Galaxy S2 but since upgrading phones, it will not work my new Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Tab 2 because they do not have search buttons, so you cannot deal the next hand in spider solitaire. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110601:	   BECAUSE HE WON'T RESPOND. I HAD THE APP FOR YEARS AND THEN IT STOPPED WORKING. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110603:	   I played this game every day on my Galaxy Note 3. I just got the Note 5 and it doesn't work! There is no way to pick a game as there is no menu button, the display is messed up, not even the default game works. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110609:	   Been using app for year's but will not work on new Samsung edge..bummer 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110611:	   Have used this great app for years. Can't move cards on new Note 5. Small low res graphics. Hope a new version will fix the problem. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110612:	   Missing controls, no access on screen. Old version worked on HTC now it don't. Sorry 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110616:	  I really loved this game but... now my Galaxy S6 has had an update it won't work properly. It won't go full screen on my mobile and the cards won't move so not happy now. I can't find a way to contact the developer either so don't know what to do. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110625:	  Great game, no ads. Doesn't work right after S6 updated, though. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110626:	   Won't work on note 5 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110629:	   I've used the app for a while and loved it, but my Samsung galaxy 6s just did an update and the app is now messed up. No other apps are having an issue. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110630:	   It was a fantastic app until a recent software update has rendered this app useless. The same low resolution, half screen problem that everyone else is experiencing. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110635:	   This app has worked perfectly for me on 4 different phones over the last 6 years. Now it is too small for the screen ever since the latest update. I hope this issue is resolved soon. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110638:	  What the heck! Game used to be fantastic but in late 2015 the game only opens halfscreen and is greatly flawed. Please fix this issue. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110640:	   Used this game on my note 4 and really enjoyed it but won't work at all on my note 5. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110642:	  Doesn't work for Samsung Galaxy s6 plus 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110645:	   I have had this app through 4 different phones and never had an issue. But recently on my edge it only displays in part of the screen, low resolution, card selection boxes are all misaligned, and the game is basically unplayable. Uninstalling for space but hopefully I'll be able to get it back 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110647:	   Will not work on my note 5. Loved it on my note 3. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110649:	   I have played this version of the game for years and love the simplicity of the setup and the way the stats are calculated, however after an update the game now only shows up in one corner of my screen. I began by restarting my S6, which reset the picture to full screen for awhile but this does not work anymore. I tried to uninstall and reinstall the game but had the same problem. Unistalling. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110650:	   Great app, simple, have used it for years. (update: This app has stopped working since last Verizon update. Opens in smaller window and unresponsive. Have to use "close all" to close it. Samsung Galaxy S6. Two emails to Ken Magic unanswered. Fix to get 5 stars back) 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110654:	  I used to love this app. But it's not working on my edge.

com.kmagic.solitaire#110656:	   I can't deal in the spider solitaire game on note 4.... Says I have 5 deals but won't let me deal anything. All the other games work, just can't deal in spider game... Will give 5 stars once that deal option is fixed for spider. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110657:	  Best solitaire app there is. Completely ad free, simple design with good options. However, it crashes on my galaxy s6 since the last droid update. Ken magic, please come up with a bug fix! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110659:	   It used to be a good solitaire app but recently the menu doesn't work correctly and I can't open the game that I want or change the settings 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110662:	   Have always used this... However, my new phone, LG Sunset Lollipop 5... I can't get to the menu! So, I can't change options, save, etc... Please help! Then I have no problem giving 5 stars! UPDATE! Menu button on phone does exist... Hidden with "recent apps" button! Back to loving this solitaire app! Thank you! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110667:	  I've used this app for years on every phone I've had, recently it hasn't worked properly. The screen is small and the menu button isn't working. My heart is broken. I wish it would get fixed. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110669:	  Doesn't work with new Google Android update... have to uninstall and install to get it to work. Every time 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110670:	   Every time I Uninstall and reinstall this app it works perfect. The problem is every time I try to open the app after that it doesn't fit my screen it shrinks to about 23 the size of my screen and the menu won't appear when I press and hold my back button like it should and it is impossible to play. I have had this app on my last 3 phones and never had an issue until I got the Note 5. Please fix this glitch. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110672:	   This has been my favorite app for years. Got a new S6 and no joy.....Emailed Ken Magic requesting a fix and nothing, not even a response... 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110674:	  Please fix for the galaxy s6 I love this game can't play now 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110676:	   App has stopped working on my Samsung S6. Uninstalled reinstalled no help 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110677:	   Loved this app when I had a Droid X. Couldn't play Spider Solitaire on the Note II. Now I have a Note 5 and it doesn't work at all. I wrote to Ken. He hasn't responded. Can someone else go in and improve this game for newer phones please? 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110678:	   Fun app with several games to choose from. Ad-free and fun to play. The only issue is with spider solitaire, which does not have a good way to deal cards, for those without a track ball or search button on their phones (mine is a Samsung phone; also didn't work on my last phone) 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110679:	   This is my FAV APP EVER!! But since S6 upgrade the screen is now tiny and I can't access the menu. Please fix this. I miss my game. Been searching but nothing comes close. Giving it 5 stars because it is the best app I have had. I want it back... 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110688:	   This is a great app if it works. Ad-free and with 4 good solitaire games. However, since my latest software update (gs6, 12/23/15), I cannot play anymore. The resolution is all messed up, I can't use the menu. Unfortunately I'm going to have to uninstall what has been my favourite app. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110692:	   Was my favorite solitaire app until it did an update, a while ago, and cannot access the menu bar due to my phones (LG something or other) menu bar covering it. Bummed out, because it really is my favorite solitaire app. No annoying ads, and the fling works just how I like. Needs a menu bottom at the bottom of the screen or something. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110695:	   Please fix the screen problem for the S6. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110696:	   New glitch makes screen small and can't play. Also won't be fixed on restart. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110697:	   Best Eva solitaire game on older phones. Doesn't work properly on the s6 at all. Such a shame 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110698:	   It was my favorite app. Now the screen is 1/2 size, I can't get the menu to stay open, it's stuck on solitaire and I want free cell. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Ugh! Please fix. I'm having free cell withdrawal 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110699:	   Please fix! My phone (Verizon, Samsung S6) updated about 2 weeks ago and now this doesn't work. It's shrunk to a half screen and doesn't work. I'm going thru withdrawal! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110700:	  Stopped working with new Android OS 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110701:	   Please fix! Love this app when it used to work 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110702:	  I like many others loved this app but since my upgrade on galaxy 6 the game is small and dealing cards is almost impossible please fix 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110703:	   Love this game but it won't work with my Note 5 :( would be 5 stars if it did 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110704:	   Previous versions worked great on android Samsung Galaxy S6. Version1.12 initially works just like before. By after closing and reopening, this version shrinks screen and freezes. Menu also flickers and is not accessible. Very disappointing! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110706:	   Update: Still not fixed.....so disappointed that I can't play one of my favorite games....uninstalling...My Galaxy 6s Edge did an upgrade and now my solitaire game is only half my screen plus my menu button doesn't stay open to choose a new game or start over a game. Loved it til the upgrade but now can't play it. PLEASE FIX!!!!! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110707:	  Please fix!!!!! This has been my favorite app for years! In the middle of a game it changed from full screen to 1/2 screen on my Samsung G6 and now the menu bar won't even work. I've tried everything, uninstalled it, reinstalled it. The screen is no longer full screen and the menu bar just flashes on the screen and then disappears when you try to select it. You can't open a new game or even quit a game. The app is no longer functional. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110710:	   Doesn't work on note5: doesn't fit the screen, I don't like the print on cards (use to be better with my Galaxy S3), & no menu button!! I tried the back button as someone suggeted but it only undoes the recent move which is fine but the other issues prevents me from installing my all time favorite solitare game - I truly miss it!! Hurry & fix please!! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110712:	   Not all phones come with a menu button. I love this version of solitare, but I can't play it without having a menu button. Same with playing spider solitaire. It'd be so much better and easier to use too. Can you Please fix this? Thanks 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110713:	   Loved this app until Android 5.1.1 Verizon update on Samsung S6. Menu does not work and play area is not full screen. Please Fix! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110715:	  After update on my s6 screen size isn't working correctly. Once it gets fixed I will update score. Great app before 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110717:	   Been using this app for years and loved it. Now it is small and I can't play it. Not sure what is wrong, but I wish they would fix it. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110718:	   My favorite solitare game. Sadly, after android update, game no longer works on my gs6. I'm so disappointed. Can it be fixed? 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110721:	   Since the latest Android update, this app has completely stopped working. :( It is the only game I have loaded on my phone. I was already dealing with the fact that Galaxy devices don't have a search button or track ball, so cannot play Spider. Been this way for a long time...seems like you'd fix this! Guess it's time to find a new game 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110722:	   This USED to be the only game I played.... PLEASE FIX! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110723:	   I love playing this game...only problem I had was it would freeze up once in awhile, other than that it's awesome. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110724:	   Verizon just updated my S6, now this app won't work. It displays smaller up in lefthand corner, and the controls wont stay up nor work. I have played this game for many years and have enjoyed it tremendously. If you can fix this, I would be very grateful, thank you! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110725:	  Not working 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110726:	   I loved this on my S3 but it won't display correctly on my S6 and I can't access the menu at all. Sad. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110727:	   But recently it doesn't open correctly- and I can't do anything with it. Up to date- still has issues after uninstalling and reinstalling. Makes me sad, since I've used it forever! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110728:	   Software updated now only 1/2 screen and menu not working. LOVE this app for years, don't want to have to find a new game. Please fix ASAP. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110730:	   Help! Galaxy S6 user. Recent updates causing app screen size to shrink and stop functioning properly. I keep installing and un-installing but...it will not run consistently. I want my favorite time-killer back up and running! No other solitaire games are as good. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110733:	   Just did big android update to my Samsung S6. Image has shrunk and menu does not work -- flashes on but won't stay on. Does work after I uninstall and reinstall, but I have to do this every time I open it. Would have given 5 stars in past -- best solitaire screen I've seen -- but not worth the effort of always uninstalling and reinstalling. Anybody have a fix? 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110736:	   I have played this game, but after I updated my phone it doesn't work right anymore. I hope it gets fixed soon. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110738:	   Need of my favorite apps. Since galaxy s6 update only half screen and menus does not work. Have to uninstall and reinstall every time I want to play.

com.kmagic.solitaire#110747:	   S6 did a software update, and now it doesn't work properly. The game play area isn't even half the screen and the menu buttons do not work at all. Loved this game until my phone updated and can't even play this anymore. Whats the problem? Anyone know?

com.kmagic.solitaire#110753:	   My husband and I love this app but since our phones upgraded (Samsung Galaxy S6), we can't play it now. :( It is only half screen and the menu bar for New Game, Restart, Options, etc will only flash for a second and disappear before you can tap one. Turning the phone's power completely off & then rebooting brings it back but once you quit, it is all messed up again. Hopefully you can fix it fast so we can get back to one of our favorites. Then I'll come back and give it 5 stars. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110755:	   I play constantly. However yesterday it went to half screen and won't play right. I've uninstalled and reinstalled a few times with the same problem each time.

It's not full screen, and it doesn't give me the option to change the game type anymore. Also, the touch screen isn't working correctly, I have to press the off to the side of the card to be able to select it. Does anyone else this problem?

com.kmagic.solitaire#110786:	   I have used this on my Galaxy note for years worked brilliantly and no advertising. Sadly I have found it does not work with my new S6 hence not 5 stars. Does not fit screen and finger contact has to be to right of the card or function you want

com.kmagic.solitaire#110807:	   If you can't find the Deal/Options with a new phone. Hold the SQUARE sysyem menu button for a few seconds. Still a great and free program. Well worth installing 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110809:	   For years now the same issues have been reported again and again. Yet no updates no acknowledgement not even an obvious attempt to adapt to current technology. As we have been abandoned I for one shall no longer even sample products produced by this author. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110810:	  Brilliant game until Google updated my S6 today. Same issues as others with screen size and touch in wrong place. Nothing wrong with the app as it was fine until Android update. Will really miss this if I can't play it again.

I've also noticed the App itself is blurry and I see that on all 3of my devices but I won't Uninstall it on the other 2 devices for fear it won't download correctly on them either. It works great on my Galaxy S6 phone and my sung Tab S. Please advise or tell me what's going on if there is a download issue and when it will be fixed. Thank you!

com.kmagic.solitaire#110892:	   Just hold your menu key and the options should appear for the game. My rating is due to having the G4phone my phone the search key function isnt working to deal cards. We also have no track ball. Please fix. Add an deal button in options menu? 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110893:	  Had this game on last 3 phones and loved it. Now have ZTE Overture 2 and cant deal new game. I dont have a wheel or search simble to deal new game. Please fix. No other solitare game out there is as good as this. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110898:	  I've had this app on previous phones but it not working at all now. It will only show me one game and not showing any ggame options or allowing me to go to a new game. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110900:	   Running Note4 with latest android build. This is still my favorite solitaire app but it is very slow on my new Note 4. I previously had the Note 2 and it ran beautifully. Will update to 5 stars if a fix is issued.

com.kmagic.solitaire#110919:	   It was a problem that you had no way to redeal on Galaxy S4. Just got a Note 5 and everything misformats and even in Klondike, touch regions select cards in completely separate columns, not the ones you think you are touching. Had to replace with a competitor's. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110921:	   I played this for several years although spider doesn't work on my galaxy note 4. Noticed a screen burn in starting so switched games. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110922:	   Features I could see on Note 3 lost with S6 Edge plus. Please fix.

com.kmagic.solitaire#110941:	   I read the reviews b4 redownloading this on my new phone and it took me less than a minute to figure out every1s problem. On my G4 all u have to do is hold down the square and it opens the bar at the bottom to start new game and opions. Hope this helps people that gave it 1 star. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110949:	   Fix the dealing issue please. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110952:	   Great app until recent updates, I am unable to access menu button to restart, new game, choose a game Hope you are able to fix soon as I enjoyed your app very much Thanks 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110953:	  Can't move the cards on the spider solitary to make another row. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110958:	  Can't find the tool to change game 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110962:	   This was my favorite game but just got the LG G4 and I cannot get a new game like others. Please fix this! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110963:	  Can't get it to deal. I'd give it a 0 if I could. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110965:	   I've never had an issue with this app 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110970:	   I like it because it's simple and doesn't crash. That being said, if it was a bit nicer to look at I'd give it 5 stars. The only real issue is the lack of a GameOver screen, meaning when you have no moves left, it should tell you so and end the game. Overall a solid solitaire app, it just looks like it's from Windows 95 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110973:	   Don't know what happened to this game, but there is no menu button anymore, and you can't end a game. That means you can't start a new game either. If it's fixed, I'll reinstall. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110978:	   The game was great until I upgraded my phone. Now I can't deal. Fix or this app is being uninstalled. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110979:	   This game was perfect for me. I've been playing it since 2013. Within the last few days access to the menu has gone away. I can't save, exit, or start a new game unless in win the previous one. If I don't win, all I can do is remove the app and install it again. That still doesn't bring the menu back. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110982:	   Looks like this has been a problem for awhile and probably won't be fixed, but I just upgraded from an S3 to a Note 4 and now there is no way to open the menu to start a new game, etc. This is my favorite solitaire game I've found, but without functionality it sucks. I hope this will be fixed one day! --------just figured out how to fix this issue so updating to 5 stars. Holding down the menu button that shows all open apps actually causes the menu for this game to pop up so now i can play once again! Yay! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110984:	   I love this game on my s3 cause it had menu button but on my note 4 there isnt one so i cant change the game type or start a new game. Please fix it. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110989:	  Never fail, is a great app 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110995:	   I think i figured it out. Go to settings:display: and something about hide menu, use long press of the task key to see the menu. My operating system updated and now I can't play. Lost ability to start a new game. Continuously in one game. Frankly, this is not the only app that doesn't work right with the android update. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110996:	   Only game I ever play! Now a new phone, galaxy s4, has no search key so I can't play. Looks like this has been an issue for a while and still no fix. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#110998:	   I loved your version of Spider Solitare on my old phone, a Motorola Defy, but on my LG Optima 90 there is no way to deal the cards! Could you please fix this problem. I have tried other versions of Spider, but none are as good and challenging as your version!! Thanks in advance!! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111001:	   I used to love playing spider solitaire but on my new phone I don't have a search button so I can't and don't play this app anymore please fix or I will have to find a new app! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111003:	   It used to be the only solitaire game in the play store I ever liked. Always wanted the cards to be more customizable, though. Anyway, I recently upgraded from a Galaxy S3 to an LG G4, but unfortunately the G4 doesn't have a menu button among any of its Home buttons. So, now I can't access the other games like Freecell, the settings, save button or even the exit button. I wish there were an 'in-game' menu button, from which I could do all of that. Until that is added, it's mostly useless to me. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111006:	   Great game. Never any issues!!! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111016:	  Had this app for a couple of years with my new phone doesn't work.so disappointing 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111019:	   No access to the menu on Samsung s5. Please fix it 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111026:	  Spider Solitaire is totally useless on my Samsung Galaxy 3- cannot deal a new set of cards - no search button. If you can fix this glitche I will give this game a 5 star rating 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111030:	   Loved this app until the latest LG G2 update. Now I can't access the menu to end a game and I'm stuck in the last one I played 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111037:	   You cannot deal the spider solitare.There are no card's to deal. Please fix this. I have reinstalled. Not sure what to do or if I can fix it myself. Thanks. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111042:	  Doesn't work on the Samsung S5. Can't deal cards. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111045:	   I have had this game for years on smaller smartphones. Now it has missing buttons on my Note 4 & Tab 4 so I can't play. Fix the resolution and buttons so I can play a decent solitaire game. PLEASE. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111047:	   I don't get it, my husband just upgraded to the Galaxy S6, which has no menu button on the bottom of the phone, just like my Note 4, but he's got the menu that pops up in the lower right corner of the screen. Could ya maybe fix this so I can keep playing it on my Note4? I had to Uninstall. :( 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111048:	  Samsung galaxy note4. Menu button press opens task manager and not game menu. No way to open game menu. Had this on many phones, would love to keep it. Please update it. **** been a couple months with no response & no fix. so I am deleting this app**** 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111050:	  Obviously you are not listening to your reviews. I will be deleting this App, several times you have been asked to fix the problem of dealing in spider, yet now in 2015 still an issue. Will not be downloading any Apps by same designer if this is the responce to any issues 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111053:	   Have S5 and can't access menu so can't start new game. Doesn't seem like anyone's working to fix it. It's a useless app to me now so I'm uninstalling. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111058:	   Can't do anything on S5! No menu options, no track ball (whatever that is), can't change the way the game first comes! No options! Update 5/3/15: claims this was fixed for the S5 are NOT true! Absolutely no way to access any menu to change game options, restart, play new game, NOTHING! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111062:	  It's not working on samsung s5. Setting isn't available. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111065:	  I can't play spider solitaire because there is no way to deal new cards. Looking back at reviews this has been a known problem for 2+ years and still no fix. I will be finding a new solitaire app 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111067:	   It's a good game for most solitaire but the spider doesn't work. You can't play it there is no way to deal. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111068:	   The three dots on the right side of screen that references the menu to restart a new game have disappeared. Apparently, the new version release has changed access to the menu by selecting the search function key. My problem is my new Motorola Droid Mini does not have a search function key at bottom of phone. The three function keys available are (left to right).... Return key, Main Home Screen key, and List of Previous Tasks key. I can not restart a new game... How about tapping the clock area? 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111071:	   I have a note 4 how do I suppose to get the menu to change games. Really like this game been playing it for a long time new phone new problem 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111072:	   In some games dealing is simply impossible one GS2, since dealing is assigned to non-existent keys. Fix this and you get 4 stars. Even after several years this hasn't been fixed! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111075:	   Doesn't work on device can't play anything except solitaire and i can't change any settings when I open app it goes straight into solitaire game 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111076:	   Can you add a menu button,? Got the S5 and my menu button is now a recent apps button and i can't get past first lost game. Help please ! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111079:	   This was my favorite solitaire app for Vegas style solitaire until my S5 updated. It hasn't worked in months. It's locked into regular solitaire mode. Boring! All of the features are inaccessible now. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111086:	   Excellent app until I upgraded my phone to one with Android Lollipop and I can't get to the app menu to start a new game. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111092:	   Where is the deal deck or how do you bring it up in FreeCell? Now you went to zero. Fix your stuff dude 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111093:	  Did not work to well with my phone 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111095:	  Do not download this solitare! There is no way to get to a new game or even restart the one you are playing. Worst app I've ever installed. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111096:	  Disappointed. Does not work with Samsung s5, which doesn't have a menu button. I'll have to keep playing on my old s3. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111099:	   Won't work on Galaxy S5, no menu button! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111102:	  Doesn't work on nexus 6 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111103:	   No search button on lollipop means you can't access menus or deal. Hasn't been updated in 5 years, time to find a new solitaire game 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111111:	  I had this app on my last phone but this new one doesn't have a button to deal a new set. Really my favorite game. Please fix this problem. My new phone is Galaxy S 5. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111112:	   On my old Droid Eris and my old Droid Bionic, this game was incredibly fun. Especially after you won watching it quickly repeat all the moves you did in a game, it was a great time. However, now that I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S5 it just lags so bad that it's kind of unplayable sometimes. I still want to support this game, so could we ask for an update to fix processing and screen resolution issues? Thanks! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111115:	   With new phones not having a menu button on them you can't change any settings. Please fix please! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111117:	   Cannot pause, cannot change size of card art, cannot save game, NO GAME CONTROLS OR OPTIONS ! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111125:	   One of my old favorites now can't even start a new game needs fixed 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111126:	   Used to love this app but since I got my S4 Active cannot play spider as I don't have a search button or trackball. Will rate 5 after it's fixed. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111128:	   I've tried all the Klondikes. This one is lightweight without any frustrations whatsoever. Funfunfun! Years later: phone crashed when opening the game. Must've succumbed to old age. Good bye little game 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111133:	   I have used this app for many years. I had over 27000 games on my last phone. Samsung S3. However picked up my S5 today and I can't get to work right. Can't find the button to restart or play again. Maybe it's me. Any help? 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111138:	  I liked this app on previous phones I owned but there is no way to deal on the galaxy S5. A fix for this is long overdue. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111146:	   But now I have a Note4 and the game doesn't work. No menu.no way to change games. I installed it three times and uninstalled it three times. Please fix it so it works on the Note4. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111148:	  Loved the game on my Note 2...upgraded to Galaxy S5 and there is no menu button. I guess you know this and haven't fixed due to the amount of complaints you have...oh well....off to find another game. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111150:	  Can not increase size of cards. Game controls do not even show on my screen. Needs to be updated for Note 4. Had it on Note 2 worked great and I loved it. Does not work on Note 4. Please update it so I can enjoy the game I love. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111157:	   Every couple of weeks the first two rows on the left will freeze, and I cannot move the cards in that row. This is my favorite, so please fix! 5 stars when it's fixed! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111166:	   I had this on my old phone and loved it. On my new phone , Solitaire and FreeCell work fine, but Spider can't be played because my phone doesn't have a trackball or search button. Please fix this! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111169:	   Great simple game. 5 stars if they would fix the deal button in spider, making it unplayable on many handsets. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111177:	   Where is the menu button? I can't find it? I'm using LG G3. Thank you. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111179:	   This was a great app but after the last update, I no longer an able access the menu so I can't play a new game or change any settings. Fix this and I'll rate 5 stars. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111180:	  No update since 2010? No wonder it's so SLOW. Tried several times to fix speed, to no avail. Very relaxing game, just fix the speed issue. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111184:	  Great game, not able to play spider, is there a fix coming this has been an issue for 3 years. HTC one does not have a track ball or search option available as the game suggests. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111188:	   I first downloaded this game years ago and it is by far the best version of solitaire out there. I have played it on many of my devices but on my recently acquired LG G3 Android phone with Lollipop it won't work! Help please Ken. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111193:	   Like others have said, no ads, never crashes. Nothing to complain about! EDIT: Like others have said, no search button means no dealing means no spider solitaire. Could use an update. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111197:	   Used to be a great app, but now there is no way to get to the menus or options or choose a game. Needs to be fixed. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111202:	   Note 4 does not have menu hard button. Without the menu button I cannot even picka game. Please, fix this asap 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111204:	   On galaxy s3 worked perfectly but upgraded to s5 and now menu button unable to show so can't choose new game etc plz fix x 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111205:	   Like everybody else said, can't start a new game... in fact I've tried every possible way to win the game I've been playing since August, and I've wasted 6 months, it can't be won. Please fix yo... 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111209:	   I loved this game but for some reason I can't find the little menu button... Can't start a new game or change the settings... Pretty much pointless to have on my phone because it stays on the same first have it started with and I can't change it 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111215:	   I use to play this all the time but i switched phones so there's no way to deal please find a way to fix that and then defently 5* 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111218:	   Please,please,please fix my favorite game . If it ain't broke don't fix it as we say in maintenance! It wasn't broke why o why did you mess with it??

com.kmagic.solitaire#111223:	  Worked on my razr maxx hd but not on my S5. Please fix. Thank you. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111228:	   Thanks for fixing! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111232:	   Updated review: Obviously this game developer has no interest in making this game compatible with Samsung phones. To bad it was a good app. Can't play this game anymore. Loved Forty Thrives. Now the only game that shows up is Klondike. No buttons or options for other games. Worked great on my Motorola Razor max. Please fix this game so we can all enjoy it. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111236:	  I just got a Samsung Note 4 and when I finished my first game I can't get a new deal. It worked fine on my Samsung S4. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111243:	   Upgraded to lg and cant play forty thieves nor start a new solitaire game...going to uninstall until it gets fixed. It worked on my old phone and i loved it 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111244:	   Simple, easy to use, can 'fling' cards, right size on my S3 & now S5. Tried 3 other Solitaires first & hated them. Eta I don't play Spider Solitaire so don't know about those issues. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111247:	   Loved the 40 thieves style and was able to play just fine on my HTC Evo models, but i switched to a LG G3. I am unable to bring up the menu for the different types of game. Please fix this! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111248:	   I love this game it is so addicting once you start you can't get enough of it so you should download this app 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111250:	  Have had this on many phones and has worked great, but I can not find the menu on my new galaxy not 4. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111251:	   Great game but why doesn't my newer lg g3 have the menu button while my older htcg2 did? Can't use options nor do anything else other than just play? 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111252:	   I used this app for years until I purchased Verizon's Samsung Galaxy note3 smartphone. The Spider Solitaire doesn't have all it's buttons to play the game there for no cards can be dealt after starting the game. I changed my rating to 1 star because over a year after notifying you that the option to flip is not there, IT IS STILL NOT FIXED! IF YOU REALLY VALUED US IT WOULD BE FIXED before it's been a year!!!!! Makes me mad to lose my favorite app. FIX IT!!!! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111259:	   I loved this on my Droid Razr, but now I've got an S4, and the app runs very slowly. Dragging a card looks choppy and unresponsive. The images are stretched and look very low res. This is the best solitaire app out there, but my phone just doesn't like it. Maybe there's a fix? If it ran well, it's a 5 star app. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111263:	  Needs a few fixes for android Samsung S4. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111264:	    to pass the time but I have a note 4. I have no menu button. I can't change games or get to the settings. Please do something about this issue.

com.kmagic.solitaire#111285:	   Someone didn't think this through. Can't get to the menu on my new phone. Samsung Galaxy 5S. It gets a 1 until fixed. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111290:	   Used this app on my first Droid and on my Droid Maxx had to replace phone due to a broken screen. Menu is gone. Cannot start new game or anything. Please fix, loved this app for years. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111293:	  Never had any problems with it

com.kmagic.solitaire#111296:	   There is no way to deal cards in spider sol. Fix it 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111310:	   Had is quirks and spider doesn't work but it's the best otherwise 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111313:	   Must have updated something, this app works on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 but not on my new Samsung phone. No menu bar can't change games. Want to play 40 thieves and can't find it 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111314:	  Does not work on my Samsung. Is there a fix? Loved it on my Motorola 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111320:	   Simple and fun, but sadly does not work with modern phones that lack a dedicated search button, trackball, etc. At the bare minimum, for dealing in Spider, there really now needs to be a dedicated "deal" button in the corner of the game screen. I'm running an Xperia Z3v. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111321:	   I used to love this game on my Samsung galaxy s3 but now that I upgraded to an s5 there's no longer any way to get into the settings to change things like the number of cards dealt. Fix this, you'll get a 5star rating! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111330:	   was 5 stars but upgraded to the Note 4 And No longer have the menu button to start new games. Can you fix this so I Can Continue with my solitaire Addiction? Thank You! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111333:	   Love the game but can't play spider on my android please fix 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111335:	   This application doesn't close when you press the bank arrow on my phone. .. The back button reverses you're plays..I must force close, in order to get out... PLEASE FIX... New Note 4.... 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111336:	   ...can't play it on my Samsung Galaxy Ace as it has no search button like my htc had. Please, please fix it! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111341:	   Spider Solitaire doesn't work on an HTC OneX, as you can't deal: there's no deck, and the phone doesn't have a search button or trackball. Major oversight, guys. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111353:	   After reading the reviews, I see where an important update is sorely needed (not able to deal in the Spider game) and after TWO YEARS it still is not fixed! UNBELIEVABLE that there is NO support for this game. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111355:	   I had this game for years. Upgraded to a samsung from an htc phone. Still can't play and deal new cards. Messaged numerous times with no reply. Playstore should delete this app because it's faulty and uses data that we pay for and can't use this app because it's not compatible with new phones. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111359:	  Can't dounload 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111363:	   It works great on my ellipsis 7 tab and on my old sgs3 but not on g Vista I can only draw 3 and there is no way to accesses the settings to take timer off or anything but on my tab is awesome if tech can fix issue I'd give it 6 stars if possible but no good on LG g Vista 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111366:	   I've been using this for ages for normal Solitaire only, but when I tried to play Spider today, I found there was no way to deal new cards, looking through the reviews I see that many others have the same problem, and update to add that funcrion for phones that don't have the search fumction or trackball would be greatly appreciated. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111368:	   Great game, works flawlessly, however, two dots on the 9s, please fix, call it OCD fix 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111380:	   My phone doesn't have a trackball or a search button so I can't deal in spider solitaire. Will update to 5 stars once this is fixed 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111383:	   I could only ask that the rules for how to play the games were on the app. Regular solitaire is the only one I know how to play. OK, what happened? I got a new Galaxy S4 phone and now there is no menu for solitaire. The game is unplayable. I can't get a new game or save a current game and there is only one choice of game. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111390:	   I first used this app circa 2010, on my 1st gen Motorola Droid. I then installed it when I upgraded to my Motorola Droid 4. Yesterday, I upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. This device does not have a dedicated "menu" button. Without it, the user cannot change settings or even exit the application. Uninstalled. Fix this (add on-screen "menu" button), and I will happily re-install and add the fifth star. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111391:	  This is the only game I play but I can't use it on my new phone! Please make it compatible with the galaxy! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111399:	   Loved this on my old HTC DESIRE upgraded phone now can only play one game as thereis no re deal or home button can't even choose what game to play have to uninstall. Please fix as was my fav. Would off been 5 stars. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111402:	   If you press and hold where the menu button is, it still brings up the menu. I figured that out the first time I played on my new phone. I have seen lots of reviews complaining about this, but if they just tried, they shouldn't have any problems! Try it people! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111403:	  I loved playing solitaire on my HTC phone. I can't deal a new deck on Samsung Galaxy S4 mini. Don't have the search button. Please fix this problem. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111404:	   i can play solitaire no problem. Freecell however is a problem. Example: I put a black 9 on a red 10 and when i want to move them to a black jack, can only move the 9. I've tried tapping on the 10 before topping it with the 10, but that doesnt help. I've uninstalled/reinstalled atleast twice but Freecell still cheats :-( It's supposed to be a game you cant lose but with Magic it is a game you'll never win. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111407:	   I had this app with my s2 and it was very fast for cards moving to the top. The s4 is very slow. Please fix. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111409:	  I can't move any card anywhere 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111413:	   I love this app & always play it. Unfortunately the note 4 doesn't have a menu button so I can't get to my favorite game (forty thieves)! Can you integrate a menu button into the app? 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111419:	   Have used this on every device I've owned, but doesn't work on my Note 4. Specifically, there isn't a menu button so I can't choose my game, restart, etc. Fix this and 5 big stars. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111428:	   This app worked great for the luster longest time till a few weeks ago. Now it's locked in portrait view, will not rotate to landscape view. Have uninstalled & installed several times. Phone screen rotate's correctly in all other apps and functions of the phone. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111433:	   Bummer. This is the app I really like.Please fix. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111437:	   Does not work on Samsung G5 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111438:	   As so many others have said, I really enjoyed this game some time back, but with my galaxy S3, I don't have a search button, so the game is useless. Please fix! I used to play it on an old G1 phone, and it was almost the only game I played. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111439:	   This had been my go to solitaire game. It hasn't been updated in 4 years and doesn't work as well on my S4 as it did on older devices. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111442:	  Cannot get to menu. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111448:	   Loved this on motor Droid 4 but now no options with new game or restart features. Uninstalling until fixed. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111457:	   Need fix for galaxy devices un able to deal on spider solitaire 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111469:	  Worked great till I got the s5 I can't use it now. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111471:	   I can not use the deal on spider, and i cant scroll down to read the 'help' buttons. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111497:	   Please fix to make this work on my new samsung galaxy 5s!!! I don't have options. I can't switch games nor can I deal the next hand. I uninstalled it until it can work on my phone. Please fix it ASAP!!!!! I need my solitaire fix!!!!!! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111501:	   Yep, I love solitaire as much as the next guy, but the updated software on the S5 had done away with the menu option so there is no way to get to a new game! Please fix! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111506:	   I love this game and play it several times a day. Unfortunately, it doesn't work on the galaxy 5. The menu button at the bottom of the phone no longer operates apps. I will change rating when it works. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111518:	   Really love playing the games I Just can't stand the fact that I cannot deal another hand on spider solitary. Really needs to be fixed. Very frustrating  
com.kmagic.solitaire#111527:	   Like many others, I don't have a search button or a trackball which makes dealing impossible when playing spider solitaire. I really liked this app but not sure why I should keep it now. Why hasn't this been fixed with all the complaints? 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111535:	   This is by far the best solitaire app. Never has bugs. Always works perfectly. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111542:	   This game worked great on my GS3 but I've upgraded to a GS5 and there's no menu to deal or end the game or anything else. Fix it please. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111547:	   This worked great on my Droid RAZR M but I don't get a deal button on my Samsung so I can only play one game. Will rank higher once fixed. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111550:	    I got a Samsung galaxy s5 now there's no menu do can't do anything. Can this please be fixed? 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111555:	   What gives? I upgraded to Samsung Galaxy 4s and now when we try to play the Spider game, ya can't flip the next deck! Let us know how or If you can fix it, we'll go back to 5 stars. Thanks a bunch Ok I just re downloaded AGAIN with my new upgrade. 9/4/14, thought this bug would've been fixed by now. Going to uninstall once again. Sorry but till you fix the bug where no menu comes up to set up your way of playing, card types/looks, simple stuff but I like to have options. Thank you. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111556:	   Fun game, and works well. The only thing is the "auto moves" on my Nexus 5 is much slower than on my old SGS1 making the finishing time in Free Cell higher. I think it may be a fixed speed based on screen resolution, because the N5 is much higher res than the SGS. Also, the cards are not looking as sharp on the higher resolution. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111560:	  There is no way to get to the menu, for this game once you down load it. I just purchased a Samsung Galaxy S5 and it does not work. I tried it on my wife's phone too, same phone - same results. I loved this game on my HTC 4G-LTE, worked great! I'm Uninstalling! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111569:	   Great game but no way to deal cards on newer devices. Needs to be fixed and will give 5 stars. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111572:	   I cannot use the app on the Samsung Galaxy s5 because the buttons don't match up. I would love to use the app, but no changes have been made to adapt to newer phones. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111582:	   Used to love it. Upgraded my phone & now there's no button for new game or to even switch solitaires. Please fix!!! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111590:	   Cards don't move smoothly with my note 3 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111591:	  I have had this app on every cell phone I have owned because of Free Cell. Just up graded to Galaxy S5 from Galaxy S4 and there isn't a control button anywhere? Please fix I miss my entertainment and I will give you a 5 star rating. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111596:	   My phone doesn't have a trackball or a search button. It would be easier to just have the deal button under menu or on the screen where I can tap it. Like a double tap to deal. Besides that, great game. Will five star when deal problem is fixed. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111597:	  I love it, my favorite game is 40 theives. I don't like the fact that I can't deal in spider. I have a note and it doesn't have an option to deal. Please fix. I can play original solitaire and freecell.

com.kmagic.solitaire#111613:	   If you can't find the menu for dealing new game, exiting game, etc., press and hold your left button (the "recent apps" button). This is how the newer versions of android accesses menus.

com.kmagic.solitaire#111617:	   I played this version all the time on my Samsung nexus and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED it, but now for my S5 there's no menu to start another game, so I'm stuck on the very first one. Please fix it!!! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111618:	   Please add an on screen button for dealing cards in spider mode love this app best one I've found so far and I looked at a lot will change to 5 start when fixed thank you 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111621:	   Just got a G3 and loaded Ken Magic solitaire. There is no menu so you can't set game parameters, start new games, etc. Wonder if it can be fixed by developer? 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111630:	   I loved 40 Thieves on this game, have been playing it for years. But just now out of the blue it has stopped working, there's no menu button on it anymore.

com.kmagic.solitaire#111678:	   I used to love playing this on all my earlier phones, but my new phone doesn't seem to have a button to deal/options. Please fix. I need my forty thieves fix. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111679:	   I have the Nexus 4 and with Android 4.4.4 the three dots to get to the options menu fails to load. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111680:	   Menus HUGE, can't see entire menu on my S4 after installing Gummy ROM. otherwise love this game. Please fix! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111707:	   The game is great except for one thing. There isn't a search button on my provider so I can't deal. If that is fixed where there is a deal button on the game then the rating will be five. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111710:	   Doesn't work with the S5 since there is no menu button on the S5. Build a menu button into the app! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111713:	   I have tried over 10 different Solitaire games on my phone and this by far the best.....Until I got my s5 and now I can't deal in Spider because there is no search button or deck. Please fix and will go back to 5 stars. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111714:	   I got the new Samsung S5 active and it doesn't have a search button and I can't deal. I see a lot of other people have the same problem. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111718:	   Love this game. i can only play spider because I don't have the key to deal. Wish the developer would fix that issue. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111729:	   Loved this app on my old Incredible 2. But my new LG G2 doesn't have a search icon in the menu so it doesn't work 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111736:	   Love this game. The only issue seems to be that when playing Spider Solitare, there is no way on an Android phone to deal new cards. I have tried everything and nothing works. So, if you just stay away from the Spider Solitare, it's Great! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111738:	   This game is okay but it seems impossible to win. I installed this game last week and I haven't won a single game. Moreover it keeps crashing and causes my tablet to freeze. Too many ads keep popping up in the middle of game play. Horrid and a waste of time. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111739:	   I have the S5 and there isn't a track ball or search button. Can't deal in spider solitaire which is my favorite game! :( Please fix and I'll review again after 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111747:	  Very good and seems bug free 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111749:	   Love the program but if your phone has hardware keys you won't get the menu button. With out this, you cannot deal a new hand or set options. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111751:	   Loved this game on my old phone. New phone doesn't have the button needed to deal in spider and there is no on screen button to tap and deal in that game. Please fix-i miss this game. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111755:	  Spider doesn't work on Samsung s3 and support has not been added in a long time 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111768:	   No search button, no trackball how does one deal the next round as in spider. Been this way since the update. Please fix this or its gone from my phone. There are other apps out there just hate to leave it with a single star. A fix will increase the stars. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111769:	   I LOVE this game on my S3, bit with menu button on the S5, it is impossible to play anything other than regular solitaire with default settings. As soon as you update I will come back. I love playing forty thieves, and I cannot find a decent substitute to tide me over until then!! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111771:	  I gave it 2 stars because I really liked this game on my old phone. On my new phone, I can't get it to deal the next set of cards in Spider. I don't have a search button or a track ball and no deck is visible to tap. I have tried all the buttons and tapped all over the screen on my Samsung Galaxy S4 Active without the desired result. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111773:	   It's been great all the way since my old HTC Droid Eris on Donut, but I just got the HTC One M7 and it's running KitKat 4.4.2 and it's a laggy, low frame rate mess. Please fix this thing. I'd rather not have to use a different solitaire app. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111779:	  Game frozen. I can't fix it. Great on galaxy S. No deal/search button on S3. Can't play game. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111786:	  I loved this app on my old phone, but my new phone doesn't have a search button which makes playing spider impossible. I hope a fix is in the works. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111791:	   Problem is, I can't play it on my new phone as I don't have a search button or a trackball. Please fix this or put a touchscreen botton to deal cards, thanks. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111796:	   Wonderful app! I have had this app on every phone I've had since 2009. It's great. Never an issue with it!! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111799:	   They were correct. The game doesn't work half the time. Unless it isn't suppose to deal cards. If that's true then it works perfectly! Call me crazy but dealing cards is part of it or idk maybe folks here might play differently where I live. I'm on Samsung Galaxy 4. Of all the smartphones out there, you would think apps would work on the new ones. Feel sorry for people with an "old" phone trying to use this. By "old" I mean last year and yes this is called sarcasm. Uninstalling

com.kmagic.solitaire#111807:	   I loved this app on my S2 but the S5 doesn't have a bottom menu button. So no access to the menu options. I am stuck in the middle of an unwinnable game of solitaire. Shame.

com.kmagic.solitaire#111844:	   No deck to tap, no search button on phone, so I can't get a deal on Spider. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111846:	  Please fix it so we don't need a track ball or search key to play. This was my husband's and my favorite game until you changed it. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#111856:	   My older droid had the search button but new droid mini does not, so I can't play this anymore. Was my favorite game. All the other solitaire games have too many ads, and don't have as many game variations as this version. Please Ken Magic fix so I can play again

com.kmagic.solitaire#112533:	   I love this app on all my previous android phones but the note 2 doesn't have the same capabilities. Spider solitaire cannot access new decks. Outside of this irs a great app 
com.kmagic.solitaire#112536:	   Does not work on the new RAZR HD, which has no search button, so I can't deal. Loved and had it on my last 4 devices, but now I'll have to look for a new card app.

com.kmagic.solitaire#112565:	  My favorite app, but can not deal on Spider on Samsung III. Hope this is fixed soon. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#112568:	   I love this app. It's one of the first I install on any devices. It works, and there are NO ADS. Ads can be ok if they don't distract from the app/game, but most adds I see in apps are obnoxious. I just wish there were a separate (without adding ads to this version) version that I could use to donate. I've never seen any problems with any of the games. Plus there are some basic options for some of the games, like with basic solitaire (klondike?) to select 1 or 3 card draws/deals and so on. And it keeps per games stats if you ever want to check how you're doing over time. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#112569:	   I used to LOVE this game and it was the only solitaire I would play. Now it is broken. :( it will only let me move the top card instead of the whole pile. Please fix. I want my game back

Which is very frustrating when I'm 3-4 moves away from winning. Then it counts that game as a loss against my stats. Is there a way to fix? Droidx2

com.kmagic.solitaire#112852:	   The first Solitaire game I'd found kept crashing my phone & making it glitch all the time!! This Solitaire app is fantastic!! Only ever had a few tiny issues with it but they were caused by my touchscreen phone & its old age rather then the app itself. If you like card games I highly recommend this app!

com.kmagic.solitaire#112876:	   After playing constantly, I've looked for others and can't find another to try. After reading reviews for others, and reading of complaints about ads and music, this remains the only one installed.

com.kmagic.solitaire#113027:	   My phone (Sony Xperia Tipo) doesn't have a search button or direction pad, so spider doesn't work. I'd love to play it - just need somewhere on screen to tap to draw the cards. Otherwise, a very addictive game! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113028:	   I absolutely LOVE this Solitarie app , the best feature in my opinion is that is doesn't use the internet &, having At&t internet is treasured . But I'm sad to say I can't use it anymore . Unfortunately the new , new smart phones don't have trackballs or search buttons . I have the HTC One X &, I really want to use this app, so I think it would be a great idea to find another way to deal the cards . I'm going to the end review in a positive manner thou , this app is a wonderful app to have . So go get it ! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113030:	   My only issue is the game needs an alternate way of dealing in spider for phones without a search button. Sure the graphics are meant for smaller screens but this is the most lightweight game ever. I love it!

com.kmagic.solitaire#113034:	   Favorite app four my smart phone but cant use on my tablet. I hope they fix soon. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113047:	   Great game because it is more straight forward than most others. People complaining about fuzzie icons should just adjust the game settings to small icons. The problem with this game is the shear number of deals that have no solution at all. Is this just for the entertainment of the developers? I can see no other reason no to design it this way. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113057:	   Some good games, simple interface, and has never crashed on me on four different android devices. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113066:	   I loved this app until I got a phone with no dedicated search button, which the game relies on to deal. I had almost given up on it all together until another reviewer figured out that you can hold down a button to switch between solitaire games, but in my favorite one (Spider) I still can't get it to deal between rounds. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113069:	   Fails to deal cards in Spider Solitaire. Uninstall. Lots of other card games that work.

com.kmagic.solitaire#113110:	   Do not use, freezes up and my phone is only 2 weeks old. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113116:	   The graphics are a bit old school. Spider solitaire doesn't work on my tablet as it is missing a key button to deal the cards. 3 stars for low grade graphics and unable to play spider solitaire. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113119:	   I play this a lot. Love it...no ads. But there are times where for 3 days straight, I won't win any. I don't even get 1/4 of the way through the deck. Something is wrong. I have over 3000 games played so I'm no stranger to solitaire. Please fix 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113129:	   my ony issue is that i could move a single card or a stack of cards but not part way through a stack. More of an issue in 40 thieves than rhe solitair. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113133:	   Stacks of cards stick and don't move properly. I had this prblem both with spider and free cell. Uninstalling. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113134:	   I absolutely love this version of spider solitaire. When i got my new phone, the Samsung Galaxy, I dont have a search button or trackball and there is no deck visible for me to deal the next set of cards. Please fix this problem so I can start playing again. Thanks

com.kmagic.solitaire#113146:	   I've had this game ever since I got my first Android phone. It is awesome and has such a small footprint. My only issue is I can't deal cards on my new phone since it lacks a search button and a trackball like many newer phones. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113150:	   Keeps crashing 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113151:	   No network access. So special permissions.  I wish more apps were built this way.

com.kmagic.solitaire#113173:	   Graphics aren't the best but I like that its not glossy and gimmicky. Function over form. BUT! Functionality is hampered in Spider in that I can't more more than one card at a time. Can't move full or partial stacks. Please fix or tell me what I'm doing wrong. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113175:	   I loved this game when I had my HTC Evo but now with my  the game is not compatible because I do not have a search button to deal the cards. If this could be fixed, I'd gladly re-download. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113188:	   Starts a game of Klondike that you can't get out of because there are no on screen controls for quitting, starting a new game, switching to a different version of solitaire, etc. Terrible interface, no help screen,nothing.

com.kmagic.solitaire#113508:	   I can't get 40 Thieves to work right at all. The rest of the game quality isn't that great either.

com.kmagic.solitaire#113535:	   I play this game on a Galaxy Nexus phone. I love this game. It has a great layout. - It was easy to see all the cards but the only way I could deal the next set was to use the search key. Unfortunately Google changed something and now when I hit the search key during a game it actually opens a search window. Is there anything you and Google can do to fix this? 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113547:	   Had the app on my old phone so I figured I would download it on the new phone. There is no way to deal the cards on the new phone though. Will reinstall when fixed. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113557:	   It simply doesn't work on a Galaxy Nexus. The images are exploded and blurry, and the action was slower overall when compared to my old phone. A pity, since it was the best Solitaire game on the market. I guess I'll have to abandon solitaire for a while, since the others are unplayable. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113570:	   Cant play spider because samsung doesnt have a search button. Please fix cause this app rocks.

com.kmagic.solitaire#113589:	   Does not work in Android 4.1. When i press search button, i get search app instead of new cards... 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113592:	   Solitare & Freecell great, Spider however doesn't have extra decks to release even though it says it on the bottom right & there have not been any updates so not sure is it will ever be fixed. But good otherwise.

com.kmagic.solitaire#113632:	   My phone doesn't allow me to deal. All the listed "deal" buttons don't exist on my phone. It dealt one deck last night, but i have no idea how i did it! Practically abusing my phone in an attempt to make it deal! Love the game, but this problem beds to be fixed.

com.kmagic.solitaire#113664:	   I recently upgraded my Android phone. I'm now running jelly bean, which doesn't include a search button. Now the game is unusable (there's no way to deal!) I believe this will be an issue for ICS users as well. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113672:	   Playing regular solitaire is easy and passes time but spider solitaire doesn't work right for the Samsung galaxy s 3 there's no way to deal the cards when you need more. Very disappointing. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113686:	   Love this app. Very addictive. Great way to kill a spare few minutes. One slightly annoying feature with Forty thieves. When there is more than one card that can be played, it doesn't let you choose which, and it usually picks the wrong one. Fix this and you have 5 stars. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113695:	   On incredible 4g won't let me deal cards during spider :( please fix!! This was my favorite game on my original incredible

com.kmagic.solitaire#113718:	   I can't use this app anymore. No menu button on my new phone. Can't choose between games. Can't change the font size. Can't do anything much. Very bummed. 5 star game if you can use it. EDIT: figured it out. If I hold down the screen button on the right, it opens the game's menu options. Yay!

com.kmagic.solitaire#113734:	   This game wasn't loading it made it really slow and I couldn't play it 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113740:	   Why doesn't this offer a way to deal cards while playing Spider while using a tablet? I tried using a mouse as well and nothing happened. It will not deal the cards using the track pad on the keyboard for this tablet either. The track pad works for other applications. Please fix this and I will start using it again. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113752:	   Dealing by search key is not working for Jelly bean. For ICS it was working fine. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113754:	   I love playing spider. Worked when I had a galaxy S but not now on my S3 :( ... Please fix asap!!!

com.kmagic.solitaire#113813:	   I used to spend hours on end on this game. Simple but keeps you entertained. Never had any problems with it until the jelly bean android OS update. I can no longer use the search button to deal the cards as it opens up Google search. Such a shame :( 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113819:	   Search button doesn't deal out the next set of cards, just opens Google search :( its one of my favorites but is useless without a fix to this. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113830:	   Try opening the help menu and scrolling. When it says sanity test failed, exit and reopen the game, and try to solve the in progress game. Enjoy! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113839:	   This is a great game, but since I have a new phone I can't play anymore....PLEASE fix the deal button!! Once that is fixed, I will give 5 stars definitely. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113864:	   It appearently works perfectly fine but the screen is too small for a Galaxy tab of 8.9 inches. It should fix perfectly for a cellphone but never for a tab. It sucks...

com.kmagic.solitaire#113986:	   Would give higher but can't play spider on my nexus so I had to download a spider solitaire game. Fix that and yours will be the only one I play. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#113999:	   It's a great game if you have a search button like I had on the Galaxy S1. Now I can't play out since the gs3 doesn't have that button. Will update rating to 5 if this gets fixed. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114008:	   I loved the simplicity of this game on my old phone. Now u t doesn't work because there is not a search button. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114009:	   There is lots of times of me playing this game where nothing happens and it runs smoothly.

Would love to see a first update since I dl it a year ago.

com.kmagic.solitaire#114082:	   When the cards are flying to the top, it crashes. Card Games themselves are awesome. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114103:	   When I first installed this app it was better. After having to recently reinstall, it no longer keeps my preferred settings and I have to change them every time. It's a pain and I don't like having to reset over and over. Fix that and it gets five stars. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114113:	   Game was fun before update. You could win but the UI was borked. Fixed ui, but now frustrating low win/ loss ratio. Uninstalled waste of time game.

com.kmagic.solitaire#114143:	    games, simple to use, never had any problems, not easy to beat though! I like that you can check to see how many times you win/lose and look at your overall average. Download recommended.

com.kmagic.solitaire#114165:	   Wouldn't let me move part of a stack in solitaire. It would only select the bottom card or the whole stack. Fail. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114221:	   This used to be my fave app and I used it daily. Now I have changed from HTC desire to one x, there is no stack to deal from. I have left comment on the developer's forum and also sent an email but have not received a reply. Others on the forum also have the same issue. I have used this app daily for the past 2years on my previous phone and thought it the best spider game out there, but unfortunately had to rate it low due to lack of com's or fix. I would gladly pay for the app if it worked. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114237:	   Samsung Galaxy SII Although this has been reported several times by different people it has still not been fixed 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114247:	   One of my favorite apps. I play it all the time and it always hits the spot. Have to disagree with those who say that the game doesn't allow them to win often enough. My win percentage is around 70%. I don't find it too difficult to win at all. Quite realistic in my opinion. Would be nice if the game included instructions for the other solitaire games. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114255:	   Love it! It's great that a simple game doesn't have ads. I don't have the problem with the "Never winning" and I currently have a win % of 69.~%

com.kmagic.solitaire#114357:	   Good app, but needs to be upgraded to handle the new software for Android 4.0 Can't get a new row for spider solitair laid since there's no 'search' button anymore 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114360:	   Keeps crashing.  when you have over 3000 points 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114375:	   There is some bugs 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114381:	   Plays faultlessly and 40 thieves has had me hooked for several months now. Three small suggestions: 1: Add a simple "flip" animation as two consecutive cards of the same suit and value make it look as if the tap hasn't registered 2: add a hi-res option as it looks a bit pixelly on a tablet screen 3: charge for your excellent work! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114388:	   Like game never had 1 problem 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114398:	   I don't know why everybody giving such high ratings. Force close phone, freezes up. Uninstalled! Fix bugs n ill try again. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114399:	   I've only played Solitaire so far -- have not yet ventured into the other games -- but I'm already addicted. The game is extremely well done with just one exception: the initial layout. Every initial layout gives me either multiples of the same number, or all the same color. It's not a good random deal. If this one thing can be fixed, I'll easily give the game four stars. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114400:	   I have enjoyed this app tremendously. However, lately when I save and close, then come back later my entire game has been cleared. I hate having to start over after building my pot (score) high. Please fix! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114411:	   Need a fix to have the display fill the whole screen (doesn't on Note or Tab) 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114413:	   Works perfectly, never had a problem. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114437:	   It gives me an automatic loss sometimes for exiting the app so I can play later. A lot of my losses came from that. Please fix. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114445:	   TSR, does not close. Stays running after quitting, please fix. Other than that, it's simple & fun. 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114446:	   Not only am I totally addicted to playing on my phone, but it NEVER messes up! This ap doesn't force close, freeze, or slow my phone down. And when I quit out, it doesn't run in the background draining my battery. Thank you for an amazing ap. Oh, and no updates which tells me, no errors, glitches, or fixes needed. Love it!! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114455:	  Great game. No tech problems at all 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114457:	   Never have problems <3 Love it! 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114461:	   Spider solitaire four deck doesn't have additional deck options Which is of no use in playing 
com.kmagic.solitaire#114464:	   My favorite version. App could probably use an update as this app does not use all the screen on my droid razr maxx.
