cgeo.geocaching#130000:	  I love this app. It's very useful for getting around the pay walls on other geocaching apps. I am having a pork logging in though. I get an "unknown error" every time I try to authenticate my account. Please help 
cgeo.geocaching#130006:	  Not bad. I installed this app a few days ago and am impressed with how simple it is to use. I've used cachsense forever and never found anything close for offline caching. This is close but I'm still missing a bunch of features. BTW. Cachsense is no longer supported. I'll list the things I use a lot and seem to be missing in c:geo. Let me know If I've just not found it yet. 1. Id like to look at my profile and check finds. How do I do this? Maybe it should be an icon on the home screen. 2. Snippets for cache logging descriptions. I usually have a dozen pre made logs for quick logging. However, selecting last log is really good. 3. If I cache live it should save the live caches automatically. Since I've already downloaded the caches, I shouldn't have to download again to save it. 4. If caching off line, my logs should post automatically when I connect. 5. How do i check and add friends. 6. In cache details, show the status of last 5 logs. Ie. Found or not found. This let's me know to skip a cache if the last 4 or 5 were DNF'S. This is a big item. 7. How do I select or take a picture when logging a find? 8. How do I look at other log pictures? 9. Why do I need to know a cache is not a favorite? If I log a favorite, I've found it and will never go back! This seems like a lot of items, however, overall, the app seems very good. One very good feature is how easy offline maps work. One bug I've ran into is offline maps on an SD card. It never finds the map, but if I copy the map to phone memory, it works great. 
cgeo.geocaching#130017:	  Seems to have problems after a few hours use. Closing the app and restarting usually sorts it out. Other than that works very well. S5 neo running Android 6 
cgeo.geocaching#130032:	  Good but no DOWNLOADABLE maps. Really hard to find geocaches without a map. 
cgeo.geocaching#130033:	  Problem fixed with loading app. Back to awesome again. 
cgeo.geocaching#130037:	  getting better all the time hope all the bugs can be fixed because this is an excellent app better than the iphone by far 
cgeo.geocaching#130042:	   This is my go to app for geocaching. Used it for years, and it keeps getting better. After the recent change of icons on the live map and the late 2016 fix, the app seems to crash A LOT! Especially when using the OSM: Cyclemap. Have to kill and restart the app all the time now. Crossing my fingers for a fix. 
cgeo.geocaching#130049:	  They fixed the no log in problem with the new version. It's usable again. 
cgeo.geocaching#130050:	   Would be a great app is there was a setting to change the text size, but several years after I reported it was unusably small on a hi-res 7" tablet nothing has been done. The authors obviously care nothing for accessibility. My eyes aren't that bad, this is the only app I can't use out of literally hundreds I've tried. All the other apps I use now either scale properly or have a text size setting, this if the only one that does neither. 
cgeo.geocaching#130051:	   So far good experiences, but found a new bug: after various attempts to clear history (even by removing single caches..) the history keeps on having 40 caches.... 
cgeo.geocaching#130052:	  Great app i use it all the time without too many problems 
cgeo.geocaching#130057:	   Sometimes when I go out to geocache the meter bar doesn't work for a few second but comes back on. Plase fix 
cgeo.geocaching#130058:	   c:geo is a full featured geocaching app that has the tools to do just about everything with geocaching once you learn where those tools are. The lack of updated documentation means you have to tinker with the app to figure out how to get things done. You want to add an image? The option is there, but you have to find it. Log a tracking bug? Sure can, once you know where to look. It's a great app, learn to use it and you will have the best geocaching app offered on Android. 
cgeo.geocaching#130064:	   Frequent updates with bug fixes and new features. The app has the features I need both for urban caching and out in three woods. 
cgeo.geocaching#130073:	   Ive been using this app for a few years now and never had a problem. In the past few months though all the caches appearing on the map have the wrong icons on them. The local traditional cache is appearing as an earth cache for example. Please fix 
cgeo.geocaching#130077:	   This is by far the best geocaching app. Full of great features and interworks with other apps seamlessly. The wrong cachetypes is a new bug, I am confident the c:geo team will fix it soon. 
cgeo.geocaching#130085:	   The good news is I have found a geocache the bad news is bugs and fixes 
cgeo.geocaching#130099:	   This app takes you by the hand (that holds ur phone) and using a few of your brain cells, takes you right straight to the cache. It's up to your own eyes to actually see it. Chances are, the app will provide you with that too. If you can't find a cache with this app, give up! 
cgeo.geocaching#130100:	   Whether you're just starting out our have been caching for years this app is the best. Easy to use, coords aren't as far away as others and best of all its free! You definitely don't get what you pay for, you get more!!!!! 
cgeo.geocaching#130105:	   Thanks for addressing the no log book entries issue and giving a solution. Back to using the app at its fullest! 
cgeo.geocaching#130110:	   This app is fantastic for geocaching, whether you want to search live or store some caches beforehand. Easy to post finds, never had any problems with it! 
cgeo.geocaching#130113:	   Never had a big issue with it. Great little app. 
cgeo.geocaching#130117:	   Used this app for years, but recent update has meant no previous logs to be seen. Please fix asap!! 
cgeo.geocaching#130121:	   Since the latest update I can no longer see any previous logs. The cache page just reads 'no previous logs' Please fix this as I'm having to use a different app. :( 
cgeo.geocaching#130133:	   Sometimes it fails to register a cache. When this bug will be eliminated will give 5 stars. 
cgeo.geocaching#130161:	   Can't even log in, made with a Facebook account i followed the instructions and can now log in online fine but on the app it's just broken and says error. 
cgeo.geocaching#130164:	   Dropped one star . Past two updates have had issue with zooming/out buttons . The zoom out button (-) will stay highlighted and will fight me by zooming out when I try to zoom in. This happens quite often .I have to quit app and restart to stop it. 
cgeo.geocaching#130167:	   The official app is unusable if you're a non-premium member. But this one provides a very good alternative. The only issue I see with this app is the map. It's slow and quite often shows caches that should not be visible (disabled, found or premium if you're a regular member). You need to zoom out and back in to "fix" it. It also lacks the feature to refresh stored caches while in the map view. 
cgeo.geocaching#130171:	  Impressive feature set... perfect app for keeping all cache information offline available. Bugs are quickly solved and fast release cycle. I would pay for it! 
cgeo.geocaching#130172:	   Great app but has a few issues. One is that my found caches often don't show up as found on the map so I have to reload them by opening the cache to they show up as found. A few days later they are back to not found. Also many caches show up as grey question marks rather than the little icon for traditional or multi and so on. So I have to click on every single one to see what they are. Highly annoying. Other than that it's a great app 
cgeo.geocaching#130173:	  I installed this and tried logging in. No joy. I opened an account online and went back to the app, thinking I could use these details to login with. No joy. I played around with the app to see if I had missed an option or a page or something. No joy. This app looks the business, but when it comes down to it is "utterly rubbish with 0 functionality". Normal login doesn't work, Facebook login doesn't work. The whole thing is broken, it would seem. Update after seeing developer's response: There's no way I will be looking at any newbie guides: if the functionality is so complex that it needs an in depth guide to teach you how to use it, I suggest your development team are way behind the times with what is currently accepted as 'good functionality'. It should be simple, intuitive, and not require special instructions. Geo Caching is hardly rocket science, and nor is the art of making good apps these days (or so my developer friends tell me). You retain 1 star - and that's generous. 
cgeo.geocaching#130184:	   Actually works better than the official paid version. Never have problems with it! 
cgeo.geocaching#130200:	    every time I attempt to store caches offline. Useless if I don't have access to caches when there is no network connection. 
cgeo.geocaching#130205:	   Edit: after installing it on a galaxy s4, s6, nexus 10, and nexus 6p, all of which were new untouched phones fresh out of the box and this app was the first install on all, issue persistent across all. Lollipop marshmallow and nougat. 
cgeo.geocaching#130214:	   MapswithMe's latest update has fixed the problem. 
cgeo.geocaching#130215:	   fantastic to use just download & go find them, use my Garmin in take's hours to download them.  minute's its a no brainer keep up the good work & it's free it can't get any better thanks. 
cgeo.geocaching#130217:	  Fantastic app works no problem on my HTC m8 never a problem still can't believe it's free. Been installed on my phone since 2010 have hand held Garmin GPS that never come"s out the box any more. 
cgeo.geocaching#130225:	   Minimal bugs, accurate, overall really good :) 
cgeo.geocaching#130233:	   Loved this app until update, now it shows me 60m away from each cache. Only able to do very obvious roadside caches. Please help!!! Android MotoG user. Please fix!!! 
cgeo.geocaching#130234:	  Map won't load! 
cgeo.geocaching#130236:	  Some bugs, overall very helpful 
cgeo.geocaching#130241:	   Crashes all the time :( I hope it's fixed soon, otherwise it's been great app so far 
cgeo.geocaching#130243:	  Does everything I need without issue 
cgeo.geocaching#130257:	   I can do various caches that were unavailable to me with the Geocaching app. C:geo lets me view caches with all different ratings, & all different types of caches too (except supposedly premium content-I don't have a membership to geocaching-but I haven't found a cache I couldn't access yet-unlike geocaching's app). Tracking is better on this app too- no more wandering aimlessly for jumping gps signals! Only drawback is that my friends using Apple can't use c:geo, so how are we supposed to cache together? 
cgeo.geocaching#130258:	   The compass (probably the most important bit) won't work. No problem with my GPS or signal, all other gps based apps work fine. I see from the comments that it's not just me either. Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge on 6.01 
cgeo.geocaching#130260:	   I like the map features. Besides using the live map to plan which geocache to visit, I also use it as a backup when Google Maps crashes. Its GPS updating is much more stable! 
cgeo.geocaching#130261:	  Tried it a million times but cannot successfully login to any of the services. Resetting to factory settings like the faq says didn't work either. Faq also says that if you cannot login, then correct coordinates will not be provided. Game over 
cgeo.geocaching#130276:	   For some reason the GPS is no longer correctly pointing my arrow where it should. I have checked every button and function to fix this and there is not one available. 
cgeo.geocaching#130285:	   I'm so new to geocaching that I haven't even found my first one yet. I tried one app but couldn't use it to figure out what I was looking for. Checked this one out for goggles and voila now I know what to go back and look for! Hoodathunkit 
cgeo.geocaching#130286:	   App said I had to register on the website. I did so and couldn't access my account. Useless. 
cgeo.geocaching#130288:	   Works great! Sometimes crashes on my s3 but it is great otherwise. Would definantly recommend this app! 
cgeo.geocaching#130292:	  Says it's installed on my android but I can't find it 
cgeo.geocaching#130301:	   Even using offline map, renders slowly. Bug with Personal Note feature, with larger note will often duplicate the text, with double hyphen in between. Which is annoying. Wish the X and checkmark buttons were farther apart, tapping on X by mistake if not really careful. Still has the best features, but I use the other 2 apps (official and GCDroid) as well, especially for the live maps. 
cgeo.geocaching#130302:	   Great app! My favourite but haven't used it for a few years. Installed again and the results are peppered with premium caches. Wish there was an option to tick so that premium caches are hidden from the map/results. I don't geocache enough to warrant premium membership so guess I have to make do with messy search results.... =( 
cgeo.geocaching#130304:	  The app seems to have stopped working and doesn't display any caches. Is this a common problem? 
cgeo.geocaching#130315:	   Awesome app. Almost never has a problem 
cgeo.geocaching#130317:	   I have been using this app to cache for years. Even when I quit for a while, it still kept a home on my phone. This app lets you enjoy your hobby spontaneously and is feature rich. The few things I could complain about have just been fixed. If you are a cacher, give this app a shot. You will be happy you did. Any chance you can bring out a version for the Samsung Gear smart watch? 
cgeo.geocaching#130341:	   This app is free and great! Has a few bugs but once you figure out how to use it well it works great 
cgeo.geocaching#130362:	  Useless. Login always fails. 
cgeo.geocaching#130375:	   I've been using this app for a number of years. It's not add accurate as a dedicated hand held gps but it's close. I've had a few issues with accuracy that have had me walking in circles. So it's not my primary go to device. But it gets the job done (sometimes) in a pinch. 
cgeo.geocaching#130377:	   Downloaded the latest update earlier today, now I can't log in. It just keeps saying login failed due to an unknown error. 
cgeo.geocaching#130378:	  I've used this app for years. To me, it *is* the geocaching app. I've seen it evolve over time, always improving. Devs are responsive to bug and feature request communication. Would definitely recommend it. 
cgeo.geocaching#130385:	   UPDATE: I tried logging caches on 05/11 and it wouldn't let me log ANYTHING... Tried to post my saved logs today and it's STILL giving me an error message. Don't know what happened but this app is useless to me now. ORIG REV: It's not as cosmetically pleasing & excludes some features (private msging) but it's free and actually shows ALL of the geocaches, unlike the official app which requires you to pay ten dollars for limited caches. I'd like to see terracache added to the account list for a 5 star review! 
cgeo.geocaching#130405:	  The best Geocaching App by far wouldn't use any other 
cgeo.geocaching#130418:	   I am trying to upgrade to premium but cannot find the link to download it. You would think it would have a simple link in the menu to upgrade to premium. I can't find it for the life of me! I sent an email to support several days ago and haven't received any information yet. It's a good app so I am wanting to upgrade. Every thing takes me to the donations page. I don't want to donate until after I upgrade. It's frustrating that support has not responded to my email. 
cgeo.geocaching#130429:	  A very useful geocaching app, I stopped looking for anything else a long time ago. It has gotten more and more stable over the years - I have been using it since I got my first Android phone back in 2010 - and it is almost perfect: Off-line cache lists and off-line maps are especially useful, they save a lot of data. There are still some minor glitches, but mostly it is stable. Furthermore it is a free, and nowadays it is open source, so whenever Groundspeaks decides to modify their web pages it only takes a few hours until someone fixes the things that were broken by them. 
cgeo.geocaching#130431:	   Better than the official app! Only issue I've encountered so far is that some of the caches we've logged on the website don't show that we've found them on the app. Otherwise it's great! 
cgeo.geocaching#130433:	   Won't use anything else for geocaching. 
cgeo.geocaching#130434:	   It has a few bugs to fix, but I can't even pinpoint exactly what those are. And it's waaay better than any other geocaching apps available on the play store. 
cgeo.geocaching#130447:	  Does not work 
cgeo.geocaching#130465:	   This is, by far, the best geocaching app I've tried. I have been using it for more than a year and have not had any problems at all. I wish all apps worked this well! 
cgeo.geocaching#130468:	   I never use anything else. It's quick, accurate and using it is simple. I've tried other apps, but this one is the only one I've never had any issues with. Ever. Do yourself a favor, and don't waste time with any other geocaching app. 
cgeo.geocaching#130481:	   Some reason now the app will not let me log in my funds or no finds. It only saves them. Then I have to go online to log them. Also seams as if the accuracy has gone down. 
cgeo.geocaching#130482:	   Every time i try to leave a comment for a Geocache, it just says "c:geo can't load data required to log visit" please help, i'd love to actually use this app! 
cgeo.geocaching#130484:	   Much better than the official app but the synchronisation no longer works. A whole day of geocaching is not syncing. Fix that and you'll get 5 stars 
cgeo.geocaching#130491:	  This app was amazing and I have been using it for a couple of years. Unfortunately, recently it won't log me on, so when I'm out, I can't log the caches I find. I've read someone else has had the same problem and even reinstalling it doesn't work. It's a shame that something that was so good is now a let down. 
cgeo.geocaching#130495:	  Have not used it yet apparently it has good use but I will use it later today to go and look for some that's local he in texas if I like it I will rate better 
cgeo.geocaching#130499:	  I have used this app for well over a year with no problem. However, since the android update to marshmallow it just keeps crashing. I now can't even open it. Tried reinstalling and all sorts but nothing will sort it. Very sad 
cgeo.geocaching#130502:	   Bis zu dem Update vor knapp einer Stunde hat die App super funktioniert. Seitdem stzt das Programm in einer Tour ab, wenn ich auf die Live-Karte gehe. Sobald das behoben ist, gibt es von mir auch wieder 5 Sterne. Inzwischen wurde das Problem behoben und die 5 Sterne sind wieder gesichert. Danke f die schnelle Reaktion 
cgeo.geocaching#130524:	   I love this app, but after a recent update, any attempt to use a map connected feature causes a crash when trying to zoom. Auto crash reports have been sent to Google apps. Hope this will get fixed soon. ... Follow up: changed from OSM mapnik to Google map and so far no crash. 
cgeo.geocaching#130531:	   You guys rock! This is still our daily driver for caching. It makes caching on the fly a breeze. My only issue is I can't tell all the iPhone users they can use this ridiculously superior caching app! 
cgeo.geocaching#130545:	   The app is ok for info. I couldn't get a map to open or any locations. Frustating to see others able to use it. Think ill remove this one and try one that works! 
cgeo.geocaching#130557:	   Had a brief issue where it was opening PDF files which obviously didn't work, but that seems to have resolved itself. Works great for what it does. 
cgeo.geocaching#130564:	   This app was working great, but then after an update the app keeps freezing with the live map and I have to do a hard reset each time. Is there anyway to fix this? 
cgeo.geocaching#130571:	   I have not been out to use this since the update but I love this app. I haven't used the intro geocaching app since I downloaded this one. Before I upgraded to the phone I wanted I made sure it would download this app because I would not go without it. Thank you to the developers!!! :) 
cgeo.geocaching#130583:	   Love the app! However, I am encountering a 'login fail' which I cannot fix for the life of me. Please fix and I will be happy to increase my rating. :) 
cgeo.geocaching#130597:	   Can you please let me to mass logging as I did a whole power trail and saved all my logs offline and am kissed off that I have to now individualy post them one by one please fix. Otherwise a good app 
cgeo.geocaching#130602:	   My friend has an app that shows caches all over the city but this one gives absolutely no results. It doesn't work at all. :( 
cgeo.geocaching#130604:	   Well, ap worked great for about 24 hours. Then it stopped showing any caches except the handful I found before the ap stopped working. Sent help request, and Lars was on it. Fixed! Great ap, great service! 
cgeo.geocaching#130615:	   It's a perfect app. It just crashes very often! I have Motorola Moto G 3rd gen. 
cgeo.geocaching#130620:	   I switched last May from iPhone to Android (Galaxy S6). I had the official app before, but downloaded this app because I didn't want to pay for the official app again. I have had nothing but problems with this app. It won't load caches in my map, and in all honesty it's a frustration to navigate. It makes me incredibly sad because my fianc and I love geocaching, and he's the one who introduced me to it, but using this app is just a headache every time we go on a hunt. 
cgeo.geocaching#130621:	   The compass on Moto G is even more dysfunctional then it was before. Now it has no idea which way it's oriented, originally it just occasionally crashed, now it only occasionally works. Honestly it's always had major issues with this phone and no one is fixing that. 
cgeo.geocaching#130623:	   ....... So is basically useless! The cache comes up on the map, I'm signed in okay, but it just says 'unknown error' when I try to download or view caches on my Moto G. Bit of a shame. 
cgeo.geocaching#130639:	   This is the only way my wife and I cache. We love using c:geo. This is better that paying for an app. I can log all the caches that we look for even save them for better a search when there is no service with the phone thanks for fixing all the issues that I have had so far. 
cgeo.geocaching#130647:	   Cool app but it the compass doesn't work at all. 
cgeo.geocaching#130661:	   For some reason, on this app, I can't see when people log a find for my hidden caches. Anyone have that problem? I need some help figuring out what's going on with that. Other than that, I love this app! 
cgeo.geocaching#130669:	   Great app, covers pretty much all of my caching needs. Only problem is my Google Nexus seems to hate it. My phone freezes and needs to be restarted very often using C:geo. It only happens when using this app and it happens very very often...hate it...makes me want to leave my phone in a cache. 
cgeo.geocaching#130678:	   Whenever I try to log a find I get the message. Download of data in progress... Please try again in few seconds or check your Internet connection. I know it's not my Internet connection because I'm on wifi and everything else works fine. Please fix or advise and I will rate 5 stars. 
cgeo.geocaching#130679:	   This app is far superior to Groundspeak's in every respect. I am extremely pleased! When Groundspeak changes their website and it breaks this app, the c:geo developers have it fixed QUICKLY! 
cgeo.geocaching#130688:	   I can't access anything but Paris, France on the map. 
cgeo.geocaching#130703:	   For some reason it's doesn't work on my Sony Experia Compact Z1 anymore 
cgeo.geocaching#130704:	  Fixed problem great app use it every time I go geocaching 
cgeo.geocaching#130733:	   It says it can't log in and I can't see how to fix it. The maps won't load and nor will the nearby setting 
cgeo.geocaching#130734:	   Love the app and helps me finding the GEO. But I cant login to my username on the app. Keeps on giving me an error message. Using a Samsung S5 
cgeo.geocaching#130740:	   Better than all others. Requires no paid membership but has all the features you need. Very good support with a lot of updates, bug fixes and new features. I like it! 
cgeo.geocaching#130750:	   This app works great for caching, and loads all of the caches around you. The only issue I found, was not being able to log a find through the app. This just posts notes instead. With that being the only fault I have found, this is a solid app great for beginners or experts. 
cgeo.geocaching#130760:	   Since the last update, C Geo crashes & locks up my phone. I have to remove battery from my phone to reset it. My wife has the same problem. We are both using LG Spirit phones. 
cgeo.geocaching#130769:	  Compass doesn't rotate on Sony Xperia Z Ultra with stock Lollipop ROM. Makes it difficult to find caches without using external mapping app. Useless until that's fixed. EDIT 23/8/15: Devs blaming it on the firmware. However, from GitHub it looks like you're incorporating version 7.5 of Google Play Location Services. The Xperia is running 7.8, which is the latest available. Other compass apps which are using the right version of Google Play Location Services are working ok. 
cgeo.geocaching#130780:	   Love this app but for the last week, when I go to the live map, the caches will not load. I've verified that the filter is set to all caches. There are no updates for it currently. I've uninstalled and reinstalled without resolution. Any suggestions? 
cgeo.geocaching#130783:	   Not used in three years and I see it has not improved. in fact it's got slower... yes it works now but so slow to download caches... maybe the developer wants to take a look at munze app... much better... 
cgeo.geocaching#130800:	  Great app but often get compass issues, spinning and running backwards sometimes. Maybe this bug update will fix it 
cgeo.geocaching#130803:	  Wouldn't work 
cgeo.geocaching#130812:	   Great app. I have used it with my last three smart phones. Whenever an issue arises, the developers address it quickly. 
cgeo.geocaching#130829:	   Don't forget to login. Lol 
cgeo.geocaching#130847:	   Much better than the official App! So worth it and we haven't had any issues yet!! 
cgeo.geocaching#130852:	   This one has so much to offer and so easy to use with no ads. You can't get much better than that. Thank you developers! 
cgeo.geocaching#130865:	   Every time I try to send my log it always says "Download of data in progress... Please try again in a few seconds, or check your internet connection." But I switch between my regular data and WiFi and I still get the same response. What do I have to fix on my settings? 
cgeo.geocaching#130870:	   Please fix the live map so I can use this on my s6. I've loved using c:geo on my previous galaxy phone. If it is not fixed I will need to find something new. 
cgeo.geocaching#130871:	   It doesn't come up I have to go in to the app store just to get and it still doesn't work 
cgeo.geocaching#130880:	   Crashes sometimes, but pretty smooth. 
cgeo.geocaching#130883:	   I've never had any issues with this app, it's really good for geocaching with your mobile and also allows you to see some premium cache's. Great considering it's free aswell. Thank you 
cgeo.geocaching#130898:	   Used to love this app, but when I switched from the galaxy S3 to the Galaxy S6 the live map no longer works. can you please fix it now! 
cgeo.geocaching#130905:	  GREAT APP By far the best free app. This app gives you so many resources to help you. You will NOT find a better geocache app.Great job c:geo 
cgeo.geocaching#130909:	   Has never failed me yet. 
cgeo.geocaching#130927:	   UPDATE: I registered on the dutch website only. Now I've also registered for the .com and it works perfectly! Great! - - - I just installed this, created a user name, authorised it, and logged in successfully. However, the map doesn't show all caches! The nearest one is almost 20km away, although my friend's app says that the city we're in is full of caches! I didn't set any filters so I'm really bummed and confused it doesn't work.... 
cgeo.geocaching#130929:	  I can't get it to go off the settings menu. I can't get it to make an account. If I have to do that through the website then you should say so (put up a box when you tap on one of the log in buttons. And it should tell you if you are new click here and you can get signed up. ) personally I think it should all be able to be done through the app. 
cgeo.geocaching#130935:	   I downloaded this app to use with the companion app for wear, but the wear navigation keeps crashing. Also this app seems to be more buggy than the official app. Apart from offline storage I see no use for this app if the wear functionality does not get fixed. 
cgeo.geocaching#130938:	   I've been using c:geo for about 5 years now and until recently, everything has been working fine. Now, the compass has a big issue that makes it exponentially harder to find a cache: When rotating the phone, the compass either doesn't react at all or moves slowly in random directions. I tried it on both OnePlus One with CyanogenMod 12.1 and with HTC One 4.1.2 Stock. Both have the same issue, so I excluded the gyroscope as an error source. It would be nice if you could explain what's wrong and/or fix it. 
cgeo.geocaching#130939:	   Used to be the absolute best but for a long time now the map is almost illegible. Text on the map renders in tiny font and does not get larger when you zoom in. The map redraws and everything renders tiny again. Using Galaxy S5 running Android 5.0. Will return to 5 stars if this issue can be fixed, otherwise it's useless. 
cgeo.geocaching#130946:	   Thank you for your recent advice re my problem with your app and lollipop. I followed your suggestion and not only is your app working fine, but my phone is so much better. It's like a new phone. Great app and fantastic support. Thank you. 
cgeo.geocaching#130969:	   App works find but since I installed it, several apps started to crash. Have to uninstall, and after this everything returned to normal. It's a shame. Samsung Galaxy s5 
cgeo.geocaching#130974:	  It has the basics but it didn't load everything and was somewhat difficult to understand 
cgeo.geocaching#130983:	   But now I can't get it to log in or map the cache... I'm on moto x android 
cgeo.geocaching#130987:	   After switching to the new app it keeps crashing my phone. Great app though, would recommend to others. 
cgeo.geocaching#130989:	   Great app never had a problem with any phone I've ever used 
cgeo.geocaching#130991:	   I haven't used it to find any geocaches yet, so I'll update my rating after I do. But for me, the hallmark of a good app is the ability to move to the SD card (I only have 2GB internal memory!), partner that with the small file size and I'm sold. The easy navigation inside the app itself is just a bonus. 
cgeo.geocaching#131004:	   Live map and compass worked great but wouldn't let me log finds (Login failed). After this update login worked but gps didn't. First I was in France so I restarted my phone and now my location stays at wherever I start the app at. Opened Google map and now that does not work and have not been able to fix yet. Very frustrating 
cgeo.geocaching#131006:	   For some reason I can't login to the app. Cannot find out how to log in to the app. Keeps telling me that the login failed. It's very frustrating. 
cgeo.geocaching#131011:	   This app used to be great, but now the map view and live map aren't working for me. On Samsung Galaxy S5. I have to actually save a cache before I can see it's location on the live map, or map view, otherwise it says 0 caches. Please fix! 
cgeo.geocaching#131012:	   Gets the job done and for the price... Can't be beat! Only issue I have with it is the Track up vs North Up view in maps, wish c:geo could be used with the Track up feature. If it had that would be 5 stars. 
cgeo.geocaching#131018:	   I don't use any other apps for GeoCaching since I found this one. It just gets better! 
cgeo.geocaching#131020:	   Since the new update it crashes every time i try to load the description of a cache which was not stored offline. Android 4.2.2 
cgeo.geocaching#131029:	   Truly an excellent app. In every way. And if there is a problem they fix it pronto. Offline maps and the use in-app of Google translate are brilliant! 
cgeo.geocaching#131036:	   Wife and i have been using this app for at least two years now and almost 2000 caches combined found. This is one app that has not failed us yet, highly recommended 
cgeo.geocaching#131037:	   Been using this app nearly a year now and have found over 300 caches with it. Never fails and is easy to use 
cgeo.geocaching#131039:	   When try to log a visit the app says login failed, but when I go to geocaching. Com the log is there i need to refresh for cgeo to notice 
cgeo.geocaching#131064:	  some bugs and slow but it is free! 
cgeo.geocaching#131066:	   Brilliant app, rarely any problems. If there is usually a quick fix. Nothing beats it. 
cgeo.geocaching#131070:	   Why pay $10 for the official app that has always been plagued with bugs? This app has always been great for me. 
cgeo.geocaching#131073:	  This app used to be awesome. But now live map is terrible very slow to load and not accurate at all. When you get near ground zero compass bounces all over. Not sure what happened but please fix! 
cgeo.geocaching#131079:	   Will not let me login with correct user name and password please fix 
cgeo.geocaching#131080:	   I turned on to start searching but it doesn't show any cash is and the map won't load 
cgeo.geocaching#131097:	   My go go app for impromptu caching. My dedicated DeLorme GPSr is still my main tool, but this offers so much, it's hard to not use all the time. 
cgeo.geocaching#131107:	   Downloaded this after all the raves, got all the screens EXCEPT a way to navigate to the cache, making it of no use. Yes, we tried everything :( 
cgeo.geocaching#131117:	   I am using this instead of my Garmin. I'm pleased with it. Shame the off line manual does not work. New version on my new Nexus is also very good. However since the last update I have experienced lots of episodes of it failing to respond. 
cgeo.geocaching#131136:	   Fixed compass in a week or so. Awesome! 
cgeo.geocaching#131139:	   I've had this app for over a year and am now having problems with the compass. I've always used it offline without problems but now it just doesn't want to work at all. Please fix. 
cgeo.geocaching#131141:	   So much better then the "official" pay app. I never had a problem with it. Great simple interface. Only app you need for caching you can do it all from here. You can even use an external map app from this app. Gotta love FOSS 
cgeo.geocaching#131154:	   Having downloaded & used at least 6 caching apps, including the official 7 one which is Shi- no use to me at all -te I can honestly say this is the first one I downloaded & used & has been the best I've used since I first started caching in 2012. It simply 'is'. I've tried all the others that make a noise as you near the cache or have some special thing that makes you a better cacher or is the official app that is basic and appalling for the price they charge for it but c:geo just works, simple as that. JK 
cgeo.geocaching#131158:	   I have used this app since I began geocaching. I wouldn't use any other (especially the over priced official app) 
cgeo.geocaching#131168:	   Thanks for your quick response and it has been fixed! I love this app and tour team is awesome! This is our go-to app for geocaching! 
cgeo.geocaching#131171:	   Really pleased with this app - however it has a tendency to freeze when using it in live mode over 3G, I have to close the app and restart it in order to unfreeze it - quite annoying when you are trying to find caches. Would have had 5 stars if not for this problem. 
cgeo.geocaching#131188:	  Used to have 5 stars but it seems of late that i can't use the compass to navigate to a position other than the cache. This feature was great when solving multis. 
cgeo.geocaching#131193:	   There's only a couple of things I would change. When you do an advance search, it looks everywhere in the world and even though there's a filter for distance, it doesn't work to just find caches close. And there's a couple of little things like that that bug me. But all and all, this is a great app and its free. 
cgeo.geocaching#131197:	   Ever since the new update app no longer keeps a steady gps signal. It cuts in and out causing my location to jump all over the place. Please fix. 
cgeo.geocaching#131202:	   Thanks for a great alternative! !!! Can we add an option to add pics of travel bugs when we grab them. Thank you!! Still asking for tb pic option. But love the update. Best one yet! 
cgeo.geocaching#131205:	   You will not find a better app for Geocaching. This is the premier app for the very best this activity has to offer. Don't waste your time looking for anything else, because c:geo can't be beat! 
cgeo.geocaching#131219:	   Novice here... I THOUGHT I was creating log in information, but it was asking for my log in information. How do I log in? How do I fix it? Thanks! 
cgeo.geocaching#131220:	   This app works fine for us, we carry a compass though (my phone died not have a compass built in) & the radar screen to make cache finding more accurate. Will be adding a GPS soon also for where phones fail. 
cgeo.geocaching#131226:	  Can't find any caches !#? 
cgeo.geocaching#131237:	   I absolutely loved this app until I downloaded the latest update. All of the icons on the home screen are now invisible, and when you do by chance hit an icon nothing at all works. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting the phone and fiddling with settings but nothing has worked. Such a shame, get it fixed soon please! Very pleased to say the app appears to now be fixed so I'm back out there! 
cgeo.geocaching#131247:	   Compass not working on s4, other apps have no issues. Apart from that, great app. 
cgeo.geocaching#131277:	   Use this all the time for geocaching. Only niggle is having to re-start the app to get location coordinates to update on home screen. Small issue considering how good the rest of it is! 
cgeo.geocaching#131279:	   Seeing how great this app is for downloading all caches (of a specific or any type) in an area made a friend of mine wish for an android phone instead of his iPhone. Only problem I have with the app is that it sometimes crashes and then does not adhere to the setting "use english" so it switched (in parts) to German which is strange. Some nice possible additions (or missing features): * download the description of trackables * addition of activating the flashlight for night caching (instead of having to switch to an external app) * allow copying parts of comments or direct "create waypoint" function since this is extremely cumbersome right now (full log entries can be copied, but not parts for entering them in the waypoint section) * the friend I was caching with usually uses a "heads-up mode", so the map rotating which seems to not be supported; personally I would not need this. As you can see the list of things which would be cool additions is very tiny since the app is already the probably best caching app I can imagine. 
cgeo.geocaching#131299:	  Can't download! Is it not compatible with the galaxy s5? 
cgeo.geocaching#131303:	   It's very responsive.. Accurate.. Try to use some if the recommended utilities, some are cool.The support is very quick to answer issues and questions, it does what it says plus some, like it a lot.. Geocache username- biggidy.. 
cgeo.geocaching#131304:	   Some error messages could be more descriptive, also toast notifications look wrong. 
cgeo.geocaching#131306:	   Was used to using geosphere on an old iPhone, until the wife dropped it down the loo (wc)... This app is just not as good; but I'll have to get used to it as I've gone Android! My main criticism is a) You cannot set a cache as a 'target' & have all other caches in order of distance from this one, & b) If you log all of your finds 'off-line', when you get connected to wifi, you cannot upload all of your finds without going into each one & uploading individually. Otherwise, the app is not bad at all. 
cgeo.geocaching#131308:	   With full internet still had problems with all info would not pull it up for me. 
cgeo.geocaching#131310:	  Great app not only cause it's free but actually works without any problems! This app has gotten me to start caching more and save time by not having to write all the particulars on paper. 
cgeo.geocaching#131314:	   For some reason I can't log caches within the app anymore. I have tried uninstalling an reinstalling. I also can't get to the setting page to log in or out. But it says I'm logged in 
cgeo.geocaching#131320:	   Update seems to have fixed the few issues I've had work this app. Will hopefully get to use this weekend and will re-review the app. 
cgeo.geocaching#131321:	  Great app. Very clear and easy to use. Only problem is it doesn't show on the cache any more that you have found them. Kids a bit annoyed they don't get a smiley face :-( 
cgeo.geocaching#131326:	  Can't find some functions such as "edit log entries". Nowhere can I find the words "submit log entries" 
cgeo.geocaching#131335:	  It used to work fine. Coords were off the odd time. Since the update it fails to log in regardless of app/device restarts. Disappointed 
cgeo.geocaching#131358:	   I love this app, it has never let me down until now. Since the last update my location stays on 'last known address' and I have zero satellites. If I reboot my phone it seems to solve the problem, but even then it takes a while to find any satellites and then loses them easily. Other GPS apps I have work fine, what could it be? 5 stars anyway because it is a fantastic app and hopefully this problem will be resolved soon. 
cgeo.geocaching#131369:	   The app has made great strides in the last few months. There are a couple of things that need to be looked into. 1 when caching a power trail the app continues to crash(message cgeo has stopped working) and I keep having to restart. 2: when in map mode navigation there is no distance indicator, it would be nice if I knew how far I had to go. 3:once I mark a cache with an offline field note there is no way to edit it. 
cgeo.geocaching#131373:	   It's fairly good. However, the "filter caches by type" function doesn't work at all. Another thing that bugs me is that the cache type sometimes just shows a question mark though that just might be due to bad internet. Other than that, it's fine. 
cgeo.geocaching#131390:	   This app is getting better but there are still a few things that could use fixed. When I try signing in it doesn't take it fails every time. 
cgeo.geocaching#131394:	   Every app has its quirks, but this has fewer problems than most. All I need now is a way to send locations to my old, but accurate Garmin eTrex 
cgeo.geocaching#131405:	   Locks up every time after latest update. Use it all the time, hope it's fixed soon 
cgeo.geocaching#131415:	   Use this all the time. It would get 5* but it does crash from time to time. The ability to download and use offline maps is fantastic. 
cgeo.geocaching#131416:	   Would not use any other app for geocaching! 
cgeo.geocaching#131423:	   Does exactly what it says on the tin! For a freebie this caching tool is my field assistant where i can bring up what Im seeking, all the information an use mapping when my old dinosaur eTrex fails under heavy canopies. Just fantastic... UPDATE: 29/Aug/14 think that is the best update you have put together in the last few months. The only thing missing is a toggle switch to have a "beep" when &lt;15m to GZ. This would be amazeballs!!!! 
cgeo.geocaching#131432:	   Compass sometimes stops working...otherwise I love this app. 
cgeo.geocaching#131451:	   Please help, the GPS is not working on either phones I'm using with the newest android. Getting closer to the cache and it looses it, pointing here and there all around. Anyone experiencing this problem? 
cgeo.geocaching#131452:	   I don't know if things have changed but I can't save caches for offline use. I tried uninstalling it but still nothing. It's a good app if you want to use mobile data. 
cgeo.geocaching#131468:	   Oh no it won't let me log in anymore it says unknown error please help I've found caches that I can't log 
cgeo.geocaching#131476:	   The app is good except there seems to be no way to log a cache when using it on a Samsung . Needs sorting or making more obvious if I'm being dim and can't find it. 
cgeo.geocaching#131483:	  Is there any way to change my settings from km, meters, to feet and miles.all I see is imperial and metrics. Which I have no use for here. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks 
cgeo.geocaching#131492:	   Used this app for two years and it was great. It upgraded and I now get a message that out doesn't know the location of many caches. Need to fix this problem. Then 5 stars 
cgeo.geocaching#131502:	  Excellent app but unfortunately with constant crashes in the latest version. 
cgeo.geocaching#131513:	   Supper easy and simple to use, I have the occasional problem of caches not logging my visit but other then that it's great. 
cgeo.geocaching#131517:	   still excellent have yet to have had any problems and is fast making my gps redundant 
cgeo.geocaching#131519:	   Better than the 'official' app! Love that I can see and store my pocketqueries from the site on here! And love ability to have more than 1 stored list! Would have given it a 5 if I could edit logs from app instead of having to go online. And can't load but 1 picture to my logs. 
cgeo.geocaching#131538:	   Update: I changed my rating as after clearing my cache the login option appeared. It still didnt find my location so I had to restart my phone to get it to update. I have since located 4 caches. All have been off 5-7 kms. A 5th was not located. Original: I have no login option on app. An IT guru friend and user told me an option is missing in this version (6.1.2014) so there is no way to log in. No login error in faqs to direct me to fix. 
cgeo.geocaching#131539:	   Keep getting "login failed: unknown error" message. 
cgeo.geocaching#131552:	   Having troubl right now. Every cashe we try to find gives me an error stating "cgeo doesn't know the location of this cache". Please help, love geocaching! 
cgeo.geocaching#131559:	   There are so many bugs in this app. If I try to load more than 3 pages, the page goes blank. It won't search more than 3 pages. Half the time, the app won't work period and just says "logging in" at the bottom, but never logs in. It doesn't matter if I'm at home with Wifi or out on 4G. This app is unstable and only works maybe half the time. It needs LOTS of work to make it a good working app. Once you fix these issues I will rate at 5 stars. Please fix, it's annoying. 
cgeo.geocaching#131563:	  Best GC Ap! TY for fixing, 5 stars again! 
cgeo.geocaching#131569:	   Simply awesome, fantastic. Have used it for the past few years and wouldn't use anything else thanks! 
cgeo.geocaching#131573:	   Newest update causes the app to stop working after 20 - 30 seconds. 
cgeo.geocaching#131574:	   I have an issue where it wont log me in and when it won't log me in won't let me do anything I need this fixed thank you also I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times to get to log me in and still will not log me in. 
cgeo.geocaching#131583:	   There is no log cache button or option on the new galaxy S5. I can see the logbook but cannot add my own. Please fix. Edit: looking at other reviews, how has c:geo not updated for the 5s yet? Edit: I just received a notification that the developer had replied to my comment from a month ago only to find no reply and the recent update still doesn't fix the issue with the newest, most popular phone on the market not being able to use this app. Time to get a new app I guess :( 
cgeo.geocaching#131593:	   There are issues with the gps, it puts me in diff locations instead of where I'm actually at. Please fix this, I really love this app. I've used this app for a really long time, never had issues till I got the update. 
cgeo.geocaching#131622:	   I absolutely love c:geo :) However... Currently it isn't able to use the hardware compass. The compass does still work other geocaching apps. I can't wait for the next update and hopefully a fix 
cgeo.geocaching#131634:	   Downloaded the app and continually have Error message when trying to log into the app. Went to the website and login works. App is totally useless. Update... Uninstalled it and reinstalled and seems to be working. We'll see for how long. 
cgeo.geocaching#131636:	  This is a great app and works well. But unable to change map view or store caches for offline viewing on my galaxy s5. Please fix for 5 stars 
cgeo.geocaching#131642:	  I used to love this app on my old phone, but since I bought my Galaxy S5, I can't find a menu button to allow me to change my settings. Thus, I'm forced to use metric units rather than the good old red, white, and blue imperial units. 
cgeo.geocaching#131647:	   This is a great app! Never had any problems, and frequently updated. Thanks. 
cgeo.geocaching#131660:	  Haven't used my GPS since I started using c:geo! (Anyone want to buy a GPS?) 
cgeo.geocaching#131665:	   I've yet to find a function that I want, that isn't included in this app! I would find it useful if the map rotated, and wasn't always "North Up" though. Any issues that arise from updates are quickly sorted and response from the developers via the forum is swift, helpful & concise. 
cgeo.geocaching#131668:	   Really nice way to organize the whole caching experience. Supports non-premium members to the extent permitted by Groundspeak (quite good really). Mutt experience using Nexus 7 as GPS was not so wonderful (not very responsive) --- unsure what is a device issue versus software. So though GPS user interface could be improved, I love the app anyway. 
cgeo.geocaching#131673:	  Really good for caching, only scratched the surface of what you can do. I mostly use the offline mode so you don't use up any data allowance. It's great that it pulls all the cache info off the website and saves you having to write loads of details on paper. It's mega juicy on battery if you keep screen and GPS on all the time. Just fire up when close to home you in. That's not the apps fault though. I can easily do 50 caches by doing it this way. 
cgeo.geocaching#131691:	  It allows me to log and track travel bugs so I can pick them up and drop them off in the same caching trip. 
cgeo.geocaching#131692:	  really didn't work that good 
cgeo.geocaching#131694:	   I can't get past the log in screen. This app was great on my last phone but now I can't do anything. 
cgeo.geocaching#131697:	   Update makes phone crash. Compass works great, when it is working, but to often it will freeze and shut the app down. They HAD the perfect app for Geocaching. I would have rated with 5 stars before the problems. 
cgeo.geocaching#131707:	   I've used a few and this is the best. Miles ahead of its competitors in look feel and price. Can't fault it. The only issues I suffer with are from my own network coverage in remote locations but no fault of this app. I blame Vodafone :) 
cgeo.geocaching#131729:	   I've seen other apps for geocaching this one is by far the best. I know a lot of people with iPhones that would kill to have this app . It is easy to use and problems free . Download it and go have some fun geocaching. 
cgeo.geocaching#131747:	   Hopefully this fix will fix it. Looks good so far 
cgeo.geocaching#131757:	   The app does a decent job. Wish it was easier to log finds. I have only been able to do it from a long press on the nearby list. The compass on my phone does not work well near the cache. But the lat lon numbers seem to be right. So when you are close walk north-south and East-West until the lat lon numbers match up. 
cgeo.geocaching#131767:	   Have had this app a while and has worked great but since last update its just not working. Is showing all caches, even the ones I've done and the compass sends me in the totally opposite direction!! Just as well I had a back up!! Have uninstalled and reinstalled but still no luck :( will now delete for good and buy the real geocaching app. 
cgeo.geocaching#131768:	   Requires membership and paid account to access any features of the app. Don't download. Possible scam 
cgeo.geocaching#131780:	   I love this app and the programmers are quick with fixes and updates. I have also been into munzee and wish there was an option to turn on munzees on the map and store them into databases, but that's just a wish for a feature and in no way lowers my opinion of this great app. :) 
cgeo.geocaching#131783:	   Does exactly what I want it to. Had it a few weeks and so far not had a single problem. 
cgeo.geocaching#131788:	   Well I have only used this a couple of times, but today when trying to log a cache, my tablet froze up. When I went to restart my tablet it was in some factory mode and now has to be sent in to be repaired / restarted. The technician on the phone trying to help me said it shouldn't have been this app that caused the problem, but......... 
cgeo.geocaching#131790:	   I use this app all the time. I have found 198 so far. My problem is now it wont let me log in... can this be fixed soon. :( 
cgeo.geocaching#131791:	   This is by far and away the best app out there for Geocaching on any os or system. No downloading unless you want to, find caches on the fly if you want to. Fantastic, I wouldn't be without it. 10/10 
cgeo.geocaching#131794:	  I've been using this app for severalmonths and loving being able to search and to log with my phone. Suddenly it isn't working right. It tells me I'm not a premium member. My happy faces aren't showing. Coordinates are off by several degrees. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it. It still isn't working. Is there a fix for this. 
cgeo.geocaching#131795:	   For the past two updates this app has not worked. I can be standing on top of the cache and the location puts me a good 2/10ths of a mile away. It never goes below showing me as 1/10th of a mile away. I cant rely on this app anymore. 
cgeo.geocaching#131814:	  I updated this app and now it won't work. It keeps saying it can't log in. I've tried opening it under my network and also when I'm connected to the wifi in my home. What gives? This is ridiculous. I can't see coordinates or the compass because it says the app doesn't know them. Shouldn't have upgraded. Thought things were supposed to get better after an upgrade, not worse. Instead, they should have been honest and called it a downgrade. 
cgeo.geocaching#131834:	   Easy to use and operate. Support is prompt in acknowledgement of reported issuses and updates to fix them. Will recommend. 
cgeo.geocaching#131846:	   Looks like most of the bugs are fixed and this app is once.again THE ONLY app you need for geo caching. . Great job guys 
cgeo.geocaching#131854:	   The app downloads quickly but fails to install; it just hangs at "installing". It's a great app, I used to use it on my old Xperia, and wish I can use it on my new phone. Finally got the app installed after powering my phone off and start up again. Works beautifully. 
cgeo.geocaching#131859:	   I have over 1000 finds and nearly all of them were found using c:geo! Droid, DroidX and now my Razr Maxx. Any problems I've had (occasional compass issues) were also problems on the official GC app or were due to my phone... But 1000 finds on c:geo don't lie! Oh... And its free! 
cgeo.geocaching#131865:	   The only issue i have is that i can no longer get static maps. Even the ones i previously DLed on another device. Not sure if it is on my end the app or the website. 
cgeo.geocaching#131869:	   Been using the app for years and usually able to find everything. Today however it identified that it only has partial data and the GPS didn't depict accurately where I was. If It can't get get coordinates right then it isn't very useful. Can you fix it please? 
cgeo.geocaching#131873:	   The compass doesn't work. Actually, active location and directional guidance not working. 
cgeo.geocaching#131876:	   I've been using this app for about a year, and it's always worked great for me. Unless of course I'm in the boonies, dense trees, our a tin roof, but that's a Gps issue. Great job on building a great app. 
cgeo.geocaching#131877:	   Usually love this app. It is more accurate then my Garmin. However having issues with it not logging me in and only showing partial info and may not be accurate. Please fix this. 
cgeo.geocaching#131878:	   Clicked everything I can find. Very easy on the computer but cannot find coordinates on the thing. 
cgeo.geocaching#131903:	   I've used c:geo for the majority of my caching over the last 2 years with great success. The c:geo team does a great job with new improvements and promptly addresses bugs. Nice Job c:geo! 
cgeo.geocaching#131923:	   Never had a single problem with it.. Wouldn't use anything else 
cgeo.geocaching#131937:	   Needs to be relocated. Couldn't find, inside fence area? Otherwise we had a wonderful time! 
cgeo.geocaching#131949:	   Only problem is that the chaches on the map show up with '??' Instead of the symbol of the type of cache it is. Other than that it's a great app! 
cgeo.geocaching#131955:	   I was excited to try this app and searched for locations around me after download. It shows my location as the Indian ocean off the coast of Africa. I live in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. Could not find a way to fix it so I uninstalled it. Disappointed. 
cgeo.geocaching#131959:	   Great geocaching app for my phone. I have used this for years on many different phones. I've never had a problem. One of my favorite apps. 
cgeo.geocaching#132012:	   I use it all the time for the past few years. Never have a problem with it. Thx 
cgeo.geocaching#132019:	   When it works its good. But after 1 or 2 finds it stops finding nearby caches 
cgeo.geocaching#132029:	   Sometimes it fails to load all nearby caches. 
cgeo.geocaching#132034:	   Cashing is a great way to get your butt out of the house and moving. I'm a truck driver and this is great. Have not had any problems with the app. I use the GPS Status app for locating cashes with the radar feature, and it works great. Also am using my Note 3. 
cgeo.geocaching#132036:	   I have a blast using c:geo! Better than any other app I've seen. IPhone users are always jealous. Would give 5 stars, but recently had problems with live map showing caches. So many ways around this problem that it almost doesn't matter. UPDATE: Raised to 5 stars due to the c:geo teams way of responding to problems, fast and accurately. Thanks guys! 
cgeo.geocaching#132051:	   One of the best apps I use. Not only does it allow offline caching but with a few setting change I can import pocket queries and have it create a new list for them. Never had any problems and I keep finding little features the more I use it... 
cgeo.geocaching#132053:	   Starting to get more and more irritated with this app. The compass doesn't point in the right direction. We log finds..but for some reason this app will drop them and we lose credit for a find. My husband and I have the same phone (Verizon S3's) and our compasses will do different things, especially showing completely different directions. Some caches will show up one minute and disappear the next. There's just soo many bugs. Looking into an alternative app, but hoping you guys fix these issues. 
cgeo.geocaching#132066:	   I used to have the $10 geocaching app on my iPhone and loved it. Not feeling like spending another $10, I thought I'd give this one a try. Only issues I see is not being able to log my finds. Or am I missing that. .? Otherwise, this is a very well put together app! 
cgeo.geocaching#132070:	   Doesn't work in America. 
cgeo.geocaching#132072:	   last 2 updates are crap! Used to be a wonderful app now crashes phone & tons of caches are missing months of logs thus also showing disabled as enabled etc. once amazing now TOTALLY UNTRUSTWORTHY! 
cgeo.geocaching#132098:	   Great app. Would have given 5 stars if the App would no fail so often on sending logs for TB's. Have to log these now manually at home on the PC. 
cgeo.geocaching#132118:	   Keep up the good work! the official app can't even begin to compare to c:geo. People need to stop complaining and learn how to use it! come on people, don't knock what is still the best geocaching app around! AND it's free! Trust me, you don't get anything better with the paid app. 
cgeo.geocaching#132137:	   Takes a little bit getting used to it, but once understood its LOVELY. Makes GeoBeagle look prehistoric. Also, developers are friendly and fix bugs fast! 
cgeo.geocaching#132138:	   4.75 : Love this app - only one we use for caching now. But can't get the Live Map to show travel direction as always up. :( If there is a way, or a fix, it will get the extra .25. Thanks c:geo 
cgeo.geocaching#132139:	  I can't find a better app for geocaching. 
cgeo.geocaching#132153:	  Was not user friendly . Will not be using this app!!!!!! 
cgeo.geocaching#132163:	   My only problem with this app is my phone! I don't have a menu button so I can't log caches mobile but I've done it on my husband's phone so I know it works! 
cgeo.geocaching#132200:	   Tr bonne application. Je n'ai jamais rencontr aucun bug depuis que je l'utilise 
cgeo.geocaching#132218:	   Never had a problem. I'm not a 5 star giver but I have to for this one. 
cgeo.geocaching#132257:	   This is the best app I have tried for geocaching. I usually have my standalone Garmin gps and bits of paper and pen, but with this great app I just bring my LG E400. The nearby function works quickly even on 3g while out & about. So far I can't find any problems at all. Perfect 5***** for me ... 
cgeo.geocaching#132258:	  Great app, better than the official GC app! Developers are great about fixing bugs after updates. This it's the only tool I use when I go out GCing! 
cgeo.geocaching#132266:	  Manually input of coordinates not working. 
cgeo.geocaching#132288:	   927 error, cant install on HTC DNA 
cgeo.geocaching#132293:	   Is there a way to not load gc vote? Whenever I try to view cache details it hangs at loading gcvote. Makes the app practically useless. 
cgeo.geocaching#132299:	   Can't get it to open or login. 
cgeo.geocaching#132302:	   Glad it works for most everyone else. Doesn't work at all for me. I mean like it won't even open. Probably a glitch in the download but I'm not interested in trying again. Other apps are more highly recommended by friends anyway. Uninstalling this one. 
cgeo.geocaching#132304:	   It was working great but updated now caches are not loading on the live map. It used to be crazy fast . Please fix. Previous review.... Great app. A little intimidating at first for a new geocacher but it didn't take long for me to figure out and it is way better than the paid apps and even the groundspeak app. 
cgeo.geocaching#132306:	   This is the best of the best geocaching apps. Easy to find compass, maps, log book, nearby caches, and events. Never ran into a problem in the three years I have been using it. Awesome upgrades to boot. 
cgeo.geocaching#132324:	   Followed the prompts to go to the website with the access code. Said it wasn't good! ! Can't get past anything to access the app at all further than user name on geocaching.com. No way to actually log in from the app that I can find. Very confusing and not user friendly at this point. 
cgeo.geocaching#132330:	   Won't load past gcvote when loading a specific cache details. Was working before on GS4 
cgeo.geocaching#132333:	  Amazing. Great app and hobby. Can't get most recent update though I dont know why 
cgeo.geocaching#132334:	   I actually do not feel comfortable endorsing this app because it uses web-scraping and not the Groundspeak API to get geocache info. However, the real problem is Groundspeak's own app, which does use their API, is rather limited and has had problems that went unaddressed for months. So I see c:geo as a way of holding Groundspeak's feet to the fire. In other words, until they can make their own app as good as c:geo, don't bother with it. That said, c:geo is remarkably comprehensive for something that doesn't have the advantage of API access. You can browse a live map and search for geocaches by a number of criteria. You can also save caches for later access. You can even log caches from c:geo and drop/discover/retrieve trackables. One downside I can see is it doesn't handle pocket queries as easily as other geocaching apps, but this is a limitation of not going through the API. 
cgeo.geocaching#132337:	   I have used this on two phones now, and it works great. I have issues with the compass and distance sometimes, but I know it is because of my phones, not the app. And it's free, you can't get better than that. 
cgeo.geocaching#132343:	   I love this app. I was just getting into geocaching and was not ready to spend money on an app that either may not work as expected, or I found that I really didn't get into geocaching. I found this and downloaded it and found it was great and found my first three caches with it with no problem.. I am now asking myself why I would need a paid app. All the info is synced with geocaching .com. You can find the cache with the compass which tells you how far you have to go and in what direction. Sometimes it may be off a little due to trees. The map selection points you in the direction and can let you know if you are pointing in the right direction and approximately how close you are to finding it.. You can even log your find on you smartphone right where you are as well as check other logs. Trackables can also be logged on your phone. You can also store sites you want to visit as well as add them to a watchlist. You will be emailed when someone visits them. Not sure what the paid apps have over this one. It would be interesting to find out. 
cgeo.geocaching#132372:	   Totally amazing. You guys have the best support in the software business. When a problem is reported, you fix it. Each update, you guys actually improve this app, most software geeks just screw it up. Thank you very much! Keep up the good work. 
cgeo.geocaching#132377:	   Crashes sometimes when I try resizing maps in satellite view, but that's my only issue. I've been using this for two years and I love it. 
cgeo.geocaching#132384:	   I like find cashes wherever I wind up and this app makes it possible without any problems. 
cgeo.geocaching#132388:	   Will not give cache coordinates. What good is this program when you can't get the cache location? Someone enlighten me pleeezzzz. 
cgeo.geocaching#132401:	   I've been using c:geo for several years now and I Love every aspect of it, features, user-friendlyness, UI, all excellent. Bugs are always fixed promptly. Highly recommended. 
cgeo.geocaching#132410:	   This is a great app but the maps function stopped working about a week ago. It crashes when I click on live maps or show on map. 
cgeo.geocaching#132411:	   Maps don't work 
cgeo.geocaching#132416:	   Used to work great, got new phone now my gps says I'm miles from where I really am, please fix! 
cgeo.geocaching#132421:	   Great app. One small remark: the "Add picture" function doesn't work properly. The uploaded pictures are not displayed correctly on gc.com. Please try to repair this. 
cgeo.geocaching#132422:	   This app worked awesome, until my last update. Now my pics don't upload, if I touch the screen - it's all over the place, and it's not including my number - on the found caches now. Please fix these and other glitches soon! Otherwise, it's the ONLY device I use for geocaching! Works great and I'd recommend to everyone! Thank you! =) The ONLY thing I HATE about the app, is that it loses my red smiley faces after a certain amount of time. I had a TON of them, no clue where they were; they're gone now 
cgeo.geocaching#132423:	   When i enter my coordinates and wait a while, the E coordinate eventually automatically changes to 000 00.000 This is a Problem and makes it unuseable xD Any sort of Bug fix for this? 
cgeo.geocaching#132433:	   I couldn't get past login. Don't download. It's a waste of your time. 
cgeo.geocaching#132435:	   I love this app. just wish it left a symbol/mark on the map for the no finds after logging, like it does with smiling face. So you can tell which ones are done and not done. :/ 
cgeo.geocaching#132439:	   This is the single most used application on my phone. I've used it at home and abroad, where the 'offline' function helped greatly. It's pretty accurate, and the compass is a great feature, as is the ability to log finds instantly. The most surprising thing is that this fantastic app and its regular updates and bug fixes come without a price tag! Thanks team c:geo :) 
cgeo.geocaching#132450:	   Upgrading my rating since tee issue I had with some caches simply not showing up has been fixed. The best geocaching app I've tried (and I've tried a few) 
cgeo.geocaching#132465:	   Runs good but crashes on compass when close to a cache. Update for galaxy centura please! 
cgeo.geocaching#132478:	   Crashes within 10 seconds of using the compass when in cache details section 
cgeo.geocaching#132480:	   Absolutely love this app.....A few bugs here and there but all in all I would recommend it to other fellow cacher's along my caching journeys (: 
cgeo.geocaching#132481:	   This one is free, and i could not find a feature i would miss. Its being developed all the time and the devs are promptly reflecting any change made by gc.com. TFTc:geo:) 
cgeo.geocaching#132501:	   GREAT app. Only gripe I have is once you have viewed a cache once. Should you view it again the logs are not updated. Therefore if you dnf a cache you cannot see of anyone has found it since you dnf it. Plus, you think you're an Ftf when you might not be . Please fix this cos it would be perfect if you did!! 
cgeo.geocaching#132526:	   Forced into installing when my existing app was crippled by an awful update. WHAT A FIND ! This is without a doubt the best geocache app out there, and i won't cost you a penny. Fantastic features, no issues and it wont crash when you try to navigate. Well done guys...awsome. Uninstalled the rest..this is the best. 
cgeo.geocaching#132532:	   Not a single issue does what it claims 
cgeo.geocaching#132533:	   Can be little annoying with gps not working at some times 
cgeo.geocaching#132536:	   Since the last two updates this app does not work right at all! I am very upset, it was my favorite caching tool. 
cgeo.geocaching#132542:	   Not missing anything. Always works, never crashes. 
cgeo.geocaching#132555:	   Since the most recent update everytime I try to attach an image when I log a visit it never goes through, it doesn't save the image and I get a message that says the app has stopped working. Please fix. 
cgeo.geocaching#132561:	   Having tried a few other applications to compliment my 62s i find this is easy to whip out, gets a fix quick and locates nearby caches. Used in urban areas mainly to blend in, the options are easy to understand an when set correctly the offline use with fieldnote upload is great. C:geo support also email promptly with a reply on sending ideas in. Cheers guys (an gals) Rob 
cgeo.geocaching#132568:	   This app is work great for me so far however when you try to upload an image to a specific log it shows that you can upload the image but then when you post on the log no images are uploaded hopefully they fix this in the next update I'm using galaxy s3 
cgeo.geocaching#132590:	   Can't get the compass to work any more just stoped for some reason IV got it all set right and it Was working fine, very strange :-( 
cgeo.geocaching#132594:	   Was all excited about doing this..spent 2 hours running in circles and didn't find anything..it would tell me 5 meters this way..get there and it would be 10 meters that way..would rather be fishing. 
cgeo.geocaching#132597:	   Brings me to the cache every time!! Love it! Only big problem I have is that it keeps brining up caches that I have already found! Very very frustrating, you have to refresh every one you want to go to just to make sure and don't think that will make it go away cuz they keep coming back. And yes I have it set right in settings. No other complaints at all. Have been using this app for years now. 
cgeo.geocaching#132599:	   Can't get it to download ? 
cgeo.geocaching#132612:	   I love the ability to store caches due offline use so I don't use too much mobile data. 
cgeo.geocaching#132637:	   This is a brilliant app considering it's free. The gps is pretty accurate but the app does crash from time to time and does not always save the log. However, I still reccommend it. 
cgeo.geocaching#132640:	   Works very well most of the time. Overall I'm very pleased with the app, especially since it's free! I take away one star because logging my visits doesn't work, i have to go directly to website for that, also sometimes there's some lagging, but otherwise works well. 
cgeo.geocaching#132641:	   Awesome app. The only one you will need. However it has not been logging my caches recently. I have had to go online to log them. Hope this gets fixed soon. Once they do no other app is needed. 
cgeo.geocaching#132645:	   I installed this app, and got a force close soon after I started using it. I rebooted into recovery, fixed permissions, wiped caches, etc. and rebooted. Still force closed. Tried to uninstall and then reinstall - same problem. Shame! Looked like a good app! 
cgeo.geocaching#132651:	   Previously I had tried the app with a rooted and modded Evo 4-G, it didn't work well. Understandable since no dev can create an app to work with every customized mod. Now that I've upgraded to a Galaxy S3 I'm thrilled again. The app does what it's intended to do and with my S3 GPS it's pretty darn accurate. Thanks for making an app I can love and make my occasional pastime fun. Beats video games hand down! Previously, Not working with Evo4G At least not since I switched to a CyanogenMod. Worked OK with the OEM system though. Too bad. Great app. 
cgeo.geocaching#132659:	   First off, it's free! Second, it's easy to use and is updated constantly so all the little bugs get worked out! :) I love this app! If you love geocaching, give it a try! It's free! 
cgeo.geocaching#132679:	   Some problems in wooded areas .....but urban works great....easy for my daughters to use 
cgeo.geocaching#132682:	   After updating the newest update, app used a lot of working RAM on my phone and forcing multiple crashes and reboots. After last reboot, SD Card wasn't readable anymore, tried on 2 different Samsung's and PC...same result: my SD Card was not recognized and useable... 
cgeo.geocaching#132683:	   My geocaching GPS took a turn for the worse, so I downlaoded this. And it really is better then the gps. The only thing I don't like (or can't find) is where it tells you how far you are from the cache 
cgeo.geocaching#132701:	   Works great! I've used it extensively both online and offline and never had problems. Keep up the good work! 
cgeo.geocaching#132707:	   Has always worked great but since last update I can no longer post my logs from Cgeo...bummer since I constantly use the app. Please fix! 
cgeo.geocaching#132708:	   The only app I use for geocaching on the smartphone. Regular updates and bug fixes and its free! 
cgeo.geocaching#132710:	   It's like taking your computer into the field. I love being able to look at newly published caches and log in the field while it's still fresh in my memory. Can't think of anything else is like it to do. Used this app since I started caching a year ago and never regretted it. Hubby jealous as his BlackBerry can't use the ap. 
cgeo.geocaching#132725:	   This app never fails me and is always good fun especially when you're broke and bored... Or just trying to find something to do with the kids even! 
cgeo.geocaching#132731:	   Works great, constant updates fixing bugs so you never have to wait long if something is off. Makers of this app really try to keep it running well. 
cgeo.geocaching#132735:	   I really like this app. Its great and easy to use and has every feature you could ever want. Before all the updates it used to show me my location and tell me where I was on the login screen. Now it just says unknown location no matter where I am. It's really frustrating please come up with a fix for that. I'm using my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and then it will be a five star app for sure! 
cgeo.geocaching#132747:	   I have used this app, and ONLY this app since I began caching. Since the recent update, I am unable to use any map view other than Mapnik, or CycleMap. This Is unacceptable! Please fix! 
cgeo.geocaching#132751:	   App is good but if you create your account using facebook login you cannot login with this app 
cgeo.geocaching#132753:	   We haven't used this app since updating but we enjoy having access to cache info on the fly. TX 
cgeo.geocaching#132762:	   Love this app. It works great and i haven't run in to problems on galaxy note with it! Only Wish i had more time to use it & go get more catches! 
cgeo.geocaching#132765:	   Crashed my Wildfire but excellent on my galaxy s2. 
cgeo.geocaching#132772:	   Used this for a year now and never ever had any issues with it at all 
cgeo.geocaching#132776:	   Been using c:geo a while and it is a nice app to use and my favourite of android geo caching apps. In the last version I used there was an issue where even though the list of caches were supposed to be sorted by distance, they never seemed to be. This seems to have been fixed by the last update however sometimes when I use this information and lookup nearby caches the distances aren't show at until you select it and open it up, then go back to the list. If these issues were fixed i'd give it the full 5 stars 
cgeo.geocaching#132780:	   It used to be right on the money. Now when I'm on map it shows me five blocks away from where i am at. Love this app still. Just need that one thing fixed. 
cgeo.geocaching#132786:	   Great app, never had a problem with it. Keeps he ahead of my friends that Geo Cache with me. 
cgeo.geocaching#132793:	   Currently the live map is broken, but promise of a quick fix. Otherwise I love the app!! 
cgeo.geocaching#132820:	   Brilliant app soooooo deserves 5 stars never had a problem xxx 
cgeo.geocaching#132822:	   After using this app for a while I am really happy with it! To go cache hunting when you find yourself in area for which you haven't downloaded PQ into your classic GPS I totally rely on this app.;) Great work guys! 
cgeo.geocaching#132832:	   Doesn't load all caches. There are 3 caches missing which are all within 2 mins of my location. Other apps show them ok. Makes it unreliable as it can't be trusted. *** Response to Developer ***: yes i'm logged in and yes my connection is stable (wifi). The app simply fails to load ALL caches, A few other reviewers also state this same issue. I have no such problem using another app available on play. 
cgeo.geocaching#132848:	   Force closes all the time, will not load caches on map, eats battery 
cgeo.geocaching#132849:	   I absolutely love this program and I brag about it all the time... Sadly though the compass has been reeeeeallllly messing up.. I'm in clear weather, strong cell reception and while I'm headed to the cache it will suddenly change course on me. Thankfully I go with GPS and cell phone so the gps keeps me on track while the compass would have me walking in circles yards away from my goal... Is there a suggestion to fix this? An update? Delete and reinstall? Pleeeease help! 
cgeo.geocaching#132858:	   Really happy with this app but recently all the caches are appearing as grey question marks including one ive already found. Cant see what sort of cache til i click on it. If this was fixed 5 stars. 
cgeo.geocaching#132871:	   I love the app except for 1 thing, it doesn't load all the caches in the area, even ones I've seen before don't always show up, so really I don't know if I'm seeing all of the caches or just some, but judging by the number at the top of the screen (2/36) I'm guessing I'm missing a lot 
cgeo.geocaching#132877:	   Fantastic - had a minor niggle with the last version and reported it and fixed in this release. I have this and the official app and i prefer this hands down. Well done. 
cgeo.geocaching#132879:	   I already scored this as a 5 * app, so such an amazing update must make it a 10... I honestly cannot find a single fault. The multiple screen format is very smooth and intuitive. Now that you can add pictures it is perfect! 
cgeo.geocaching#132884:	   WOW! As a new geocacher I found the main website inpenetrable and barely managed to create an account. This app solved all immediate problems and I was off hunting immediately. Then I wanted to post a picture as part of my log and could not. The geocacher website has an icon which on a smartphone is impossible to read . Then today the update added this feature to the APP! WELL THIS IS NOW EVERYTHING YOU NEED IN ONE PLACE! 5Stars Well done and keep on caching. (Is there support for listing a cache/trackable 
cgeo.geocaching#132889:	   I love this app. Best geocache app I have used. I have not used Groundspeak's because of the price but from what I have seen this is better. My only suggestion would be to incorporate some additional functionality like the app "Precision GPS" to get more accurate location data. Otherwise this is one of the best apps I have used for anything! 
cgeo.geocaching#132908:	   This is a great app. I do have problems from time to time when pulling up the map not seeing all the caches. 
cgeo.geocaching#132917:	   This is honestly the best geocaching app I have seen so far. A few members of my family have purchased the official Geocaching app, but even that pales in comparsion to c:geo. And it being free make it just that much better. It is accurate, fast, ergonamic and easy to use. My only problem might be that the "nearby" tab takes a long time to load, so I just normally use the live map. Regardless, I HIGHLY reccomend this app. 
cgeo.geocaching#132921:	   I was having trouble with satellite maps but reboot fixed.  
cgeo.geocaching#132924:	   Great app but compuss not working with my HTC Desire c :( 
cgeo.geocaching#132925:	   Best app for GC. The devs are awesome too. Always quick to address issues. Love c:geo! 
cgeo.geocaching#132926:	   Love the app. Only issue is the lack of autocorrect on 'log visit' screen. I have a physical keyboard but it doesn't fix words (I.e. il should become I'll.) 
cgeo.geocaching#132928:	   Live Map causes the app to crash on my ASUS tablet. [update] Works fine on my HTC phone. [update 2] The compass seems slow to reorient itself, if at all. Even though I was walking towards the cache, the compass was pointing in a completely different direction. I had to use the decreasing distance rather than the compass to find the cache. [update 3] After a couple of updates on my ASUS table and still experiencing the crash, I went to the app list and emptied the cache for this app, and forced a stop. Now the Live Map works. 
cgeo.geocaching#132933:	   Doesn't work on the samsung captivate, causes the phone to freeze...worked in the past 
cgeo.geocaching#132940:	  I can't login & there is no update 
cgeo.geocaching#132942:	   Every once in a while, the coordinates and live compass are way off. Sometimes it doesn't load all locations in Live map, or takes a long time. Otherwise, it works amazingly well 92% of the time. Also, it's free...can't beat that. 
cgeo.geocaching#132947:	   For some reason unknown to me, the compass gives me false information. And every time I close and reopen the compass it changes the distance and direction even if I haven't moved, please help 
cgeo.geocaching#132966:	   Having the access to geocache pretty much anywhere at the spur of the moment is great. I still use my GPSr if I am out of the city or somewhere that coverage isn't as strong, but otherwise it's an awesome app. Best part, it's free. I think the support is great and haven't had any issues except for when I am in a bad service area and to me, that's more of coverage and phone vs. application issue. If I could give 6 stars, I would! 
cgeo.geocaching#132969:	   Works perfectly,the send2c:geo function makes it so easy to use and download the cache data! I only have a small problem getting it to talk to Sygic, but I am hopeful this will be fixed soon. Great work! 
cgeo.geocaching#132972:	   the application works amazingly, but when I try to look at static maps I get a black screen, and when I try to refresh it crashes. pleasd 
cgeo.geocaching#132981:	   This will not work since the last upgrade. ? 
cgeo.geocaching#132986:	   Great features, but it parses the ridiculously slow website, which can easily lead to hanging and timeout issues. Should probably go for local caching to ameliorate the problem. 
cgeo.geocaching#132987:	  Love doing this glad they fixed it.. 
cgeo.geocaching#133011:	   Brilliant geocaching app. The offline maps are a great feature and finding and logging caches is easy. My only request would be a way to cache opencyclemap tiles indefinitely so you can use them offline too as I can't work out how to get these as an offline map. 
cgeo.geocaching#133024:	   Everyone I want to find I get an error message that it can't locate cache. Pretty much useless so far! 
cgeo.geocaching#133028:	   This app actually restarted my interest in geocaching again..no fatal problems with it at all....i like it more than the paid app from gc.. 
cgeo.geocaching#133037:	   Not one single request (loading the live map, finding nearby caches, or searching by GC code) could be completed without the program crashing. 
cgeo.geocaching#133040:	   I love this ap it runs smooth I have never had a problem so far and I have had it for over a year on three different phones. 
cgeo.geocaching#133044:	   I have been using this app on 3 different devices including a Motorola milestone, LG l7, and now a Samsung GS2 HD LTE. Very few errors or glitches but works best on a device with good GPS hardware. By far the more superior app over the official geacaching app. Thanks for the solid development efforts! Samsung Galaxy S2 HD LTE 
cgeo.geocaching#133045:	   I paid for the geocaceh app. Its also great. But phone crashed and didnt want to pay again. I have used this app a lot and its the best. Thanks. 
cgeo.geocaching#133046:	   I have no complaints whatsoever. This app is intuitive and has never failed.and best of all, it's free. Would be well worth a couple of bucks. Especially since the groundspeak app is 10 bucks. 
cgeo.geocaching#133065:	   I'm having issues with the traditional only filter not working after resizing the map. 
cgeo.geocaching#133068:	   Thanks for the app. Very stable, can do the whole of my caching while out and about. Only negative is the sorting of caches by distance doesn't work correctly unless they are stored offline. 
cgeo.geocaching#133080:	   Live map isn't working. :( what's wrong? I still love the app. But please fix...ASAP!! 
cgeo.geocaching#133082:	   After the recent update it does everything I could want without any issues 
cgeo.geocaching#133097:	   Occasional bugs and consistent typing in coded words is a turn off 
cgeo.geocaching#133099:	   Tried on a HTC desire s and HTC wildfire. The GPS is enabled on both phones but buggy c;geo won't use it to update location, so can't find geocaches. 
cgeo.geocaching#133106:	   Love this app on my GS3, but when loading Live Maps on my Nexus 7 it crashes out. Still, definitely a great app for geocaching. 
cgeo.geocaching#133108:	   I felt I had to update this from 4 to 5 stars. The crew who are spending their own free time updating, fixing and doing everything else for this app w/o monetary compensation are just kicking major butt. This is by far the best Geocaching App out there bar none. I've put in a few suggestions over time for improvement and most have been implemented. I've been pulling the nightly builds to get the latest and greatest and would recommend to anyone to do this. I've found many features that I didn't expect hidden in the tool, making it extremely flexible such as displaying only the caches you've loaded into your stored list (via GPX or simply storing when viewing a cache) within Live Map (when in live map, simply go to menu -> disable live) and it stops pulling data and only pulls caches in you GPX files - great data saver. Awesome use of OSM Maps, recently nighly build is making these even easier to select and use. 
cgeo.geocaching#133114:	   This program makes it easier to decide to just pick up and go geocaching. The GPS on my phone occasionally erratic, but that is a hardware issue. The chief issue that I have with this app is the filtering options. When I am looking for nearby caches, I want to filter my found caches out. There really is not a good reason for me to want to see only found caches. Change the filter options to remove caches with particular attributes instead of including and this would be five star worthy. 
cgeo.geocaching#133121:	   Live map isn't working anymore. 
cgeo.geocaching#133127:	   App wasn't working, force closed at every click. Deleted and re-installed and did not download database as suggested. App is now functioning perfectly. Yay! 
cgeo.geocaching#133131:	   It wont let me do a thing without force closing! Otherwise it was 5 stars. Please fix the issue 
cgeo.geocaching#133142:	   I use this and no gps unit. We love how well it works and wouldn't use anything else. 
cgeo.geocaching#133144:	   The best free app for geocaching. Lots of nice options. Navigating way-points, viewing images, logging a find, logging a travel bug, save descriptions to memory for 'offline' geocaches... The list goes on. :-) 
cgeo.geocaching#133145:	   I've been geocaching for almost 10 years now (on and off), and have used at least three different GPS's and various cellphones. I just recently switched to an Android system and gave this app a try. I find it quite impressive, though I have to say that its biggest downfall is that it doesn't consistently show all the caches in the area. I geocached with two other people using different devices and theirs clearly had a lot more caches shown on their maps. Please fix! Would love to continue using this app! 
cgeo.geocaching#133152:	   This app force closes every time I try to open it. I'll update my rating if it's fixed. 
cgeo.geocaching#133156:	   Great overall app but have had consistent issues for over a year now. Nearby never loads any caches and the live map is slow to load everything, and I hate that it has to reload when panning. Have recently had a ton of ?? caches appear and disappear frequently too. Found a consistent bug when on the live map and I choose show as list. Fc's every time. Great free app though! Have had plenty of good times! 
cgeo.geocaching#133165:	   The application is useless! It has a build-in feature that introduces random error into cache location to make you pay for it. This is proudly explained at developer's website in the FAQ section. So, good luck in finding! 
cgeo.geocaching#133185:	   The app itself is very well-made and user friendly,but it absolutely DEVOURS the battery,and it's not even running in the background! Fix this for 5 stars!! 
cgeo.geocaching#133190:	   So easy to use. has all the necessary features and more. never any problems on my galaxy sII. thanks! 
cgeo.geocaching#133191:	   Plain & simple, it doesn't get any better! I use this App on a daily basis. I've tried others but this is number one. Thank you c:geo 
cgeo.geocaching#133192:	   Just wish you'd fix the live map bug so it would hide all your found caches instead of displaying a thousand gray little question marks, or simply labeling everything as a puzzle cache. Really annoying when trying to narrow down what's left in your area to track down. 
cgeo.geocaching#133196:	   Love the app, but getting really fed up with all the problems. Live map doesnt show caches, coordinates are 40+ foot off. Im an active cacher and would love to continue to support this app. Please update! 
cgeo.geocaching#133197:	   Great program. Keeps crashing when moving to map -Samsung galaxy 2. Still brilliant though. 
cgeo.geocaching#133198:	   Pagefile error 
cgeo.geocaching#133199:	   Useful with plenty of settings. But: 1) Crashes always when clicking "show as list" from Nearby map view. 2) Often needs restart for live map to update/to show geocaches. 3) List view's "sort by distance" doesn't sort list correctly. Otherwise good app, thanks for your hard work! 
cgeo.geocaching#133207:	   Great app but it seems to drain the battery even when not running. Installed this on both mine (galaxy s2) and my wife (galaxy s1) and both batteries started draining very badly. Took off both phones and battery life back to normal. Pity as it is a great app. 
cgeo.geocaching#133213:	   Never have had any problems with this app. Always ready for a cache. Never has crashed. 
cgeo.geocaching#133217:	   Never works on galaxy ace, worked for 5 mins once. Will not load pages, and somehow always destroys my service so nothing will dl our send txt. Poor quality app, no support. 
cgeo.geocaching#133244:	   Its a useful app when not constantly crashing. Interface is cluttered and non intuitive. 
cgeo.geocaching#133251:	   This is much better then the Geocaching app that costs $10. I wish I knew about this app before I purchased the other. Never had any problems, no crashing, no lost coordinates and super easy to use, my 8 year old loves it 
cgeo.geocaching#133252:	   Crashes every time I use it 
cgeo.geocaching#133262:	   Really like the free version. My son has the paid version on his iPhone and the free version is better. The only complaint I have is that you can't post pics on the free version...of they fix this, it will be perfect! 
cgeo.geocaching#133264:	   I haven't used this in months and out of nowhere I get a force close notification from it. WTH???? It just starts ITSELF RANDOMLY????? 
cgeo.geocaching#133272:	   Seemed to work great at first. Keeps crashing and so slow I just used my GPS. Hoping reinstall might fix it. 
cgeo.geocaching#133278:	   I love this app. Never had it crash yet. Only problem is i see caches in an area but when i finally get the time to go look for them, the map doesn't show them. As soon as i get home or pack my bike up to leave. The caches show themselves. 
cgeo.geocaching#133281:	   Has crashed a number of times on my Sony Ericsson Xperia Mini, otherwise great, leads me to the caches. Takes a bit of time to find all the functions, but that's my own patience that is at fault. :/ 
cgeo.geocaching#133286:	   Seems to crash a lot. A lot. I've never exited the app manually since I downloaded it. The new update has made things run a little faster, though it now crashes even more regularly. My HTC runs everything else perfectly, so I can't reach any other conclusion than that this app is very, very broken. 
cgeo.geocaching#133291:	   I've used this app for the longest and it is better than the one my husband uses on his iPhone. Only one problem...he logs all our finds from his phone, but I have to uninstall and reinstall the app to get smiley faces on the ones we've located. It used to show up immediately, but not anymore. I wish this could be corrected. Will continue to use though. 
cgeo.geocaching#133293:	   Functional and free. Only found one issue - that it doesn't sort by distance at all. Seems random. Other than that...great 
cgeo.geocaching#133312:	   The best i have used seem to have a problem when switching to compass it hangs some times but after a few seconds its back running again if you use this app download the offline maps and store your days caches then you dont need network connection at all 
cgeo.geocaching#133334:	   This app is great, first time geocacher and this really made it easy to get into. Only thing I noticed is it does not load all the caches on the map, not sure what it is about but amazing application otherwise. 
cgeo.geocaching#133339:	   Use it from beginning and found very good app. The only one thing I miss is the filter for premium member only as many in my area and couldn't save them for offline use. 
cgeo.geocaching#133342:	   Droid X. . . Had worked okay, but the live maps located me a few miles away from my actual location. It has great interface. Ease of use is medium, but easier after I went to website & read tutorial. Now program force closes. Hope bug gets fixed soon. . . 
cgeo.geocaching#133348:	   I remember the fist caches that I found. You must bring with you the GPS planning the search in advance. However, thanks to applications like this, you can decide to search a cache any time, anywhere. Highly recommended. The only problem with this application is the speed to find near caches. The access to the information is very slow. It is much better the official application. So, meanwhile this is not fixed, I change my score to 4 stars and begin to use the official app. 
cgeo.geocaching#133355:	   For a free app, this thing it's great! Does what it's supposed to without yet crashes! Motorola RAZR. 
cgeo.geocaching#133362:	   Pretty good. I have tried but can not find anything more suitable than c:geo. I find the compass and guidance tools to sometime get stuck and non reaponsive but i cannot say a bad thing about this app. 
cgeo.geocaching#133373:	   Please, fix live map. It's a amazing feature. :) 
cgeo.geocaching#133380:	   I could not find anything with this app. So a friend with the offical geo cache app and I went out and found some with him . This one was showing we were at it when in reality we were 20 meters away still . Don't download !!!!! 
cgeo.geocaching#133388:	   I used to love this app til about a year ago when it switch to open source (I think that's what they called it) well anyways it always force closes now when I try to view the map. Any suggestions to fix this on my DROID x? Launce.soult (at) gmail dot com. 
cgeo.geocaching#133402:	   The app doesn't accurately pin the geocache locations. can't use it at all! 
cgeo.geocaching#133408:	   It took me a few tries to get it to work, but it works great after I figured I was the problem. Love going with my kids to find treasures. 
cgeo.geocaching#133413:	   The problem is that the Geocahing website updated the live map. They are fixing that. So chill. Go to send 2 c;Geo to store your cached offline for now. 
cgeo.geocaching#133416:	   Will not load nearby caches. Slow running. Liked old version better. May spend the $10.00 and get the geocach version from groundspeak. 
cgeo.geocaching#133418:	   Couldn't, or at least wouldn't, cache without it. Just wish it would crash less 
cgeo.geocaching#133423:	   I was real upset that I couldn't use my phone to fins any cashes lately but the newer updates have fixed it all :) ima happy camper now 
cgeo.geocaching#133424:	   I've been a long time user. I've been having troubles with it automatically updating and crashing while updating. Love your app and all its done great job. 
cgeo.geocaching#133425:	   Been using this superb app for a while and love it. It's my favourite app. But the latest update keeps crashing my galaxy ace. It keeps saying this app is not installed on my phone. I have to keep re installing it. 
cgeo.geocaching#133429:	   An essential app. Love how you can log directly from app. Good use of map. Live map still seems to be borked.. takes an eternity to load, and even when it does, the nearest caches are missing! Please fix. 
cgeo.geocaching#133432:	   Just a fantastic Geocaching app. Especially love the ability to store caches and the offline maps. Even the crashes I previously endured have disappeared with the recent update. Thanks c:geo team! 
cgeo.geocaching#133435:	   Great app. I like using the navigation only use GPS'r when I don't get signal. 
cgeo.geocaching#133438:	   Nice functionality, but does have a tendancy to crash, or even reboot my phone entirely. Also sometimes doesn't load caches on the live map 
cgeo.geocaching#133463:	   , makes geocaching easy, convenient and fun. PLEASE FIX the ? on the caches so we can see cache types and smileys without having to click twice on it!!!!!! 
cgeo.geocaching#133464:	   App works very well for geocacheing. The compass can be pretty off at times but with the install of GPS status, I prefer that compass a lot more. It can also be launched from the cgeo map screen, which is really convenient. Another obvious issue is that not all caches load all the time when using Live Map. You know they are there but they sometimes don't show up. My main issue with the app is that logs posted on the actual website may or may not show up on the apps log screen. 
cgeo.geocaching#133465:	   Losing live map stinks. Was my favorite app until now. Looking for app with this feature to use. Please fix so I don't have to. 
cgeo.geocaching#133473:	   Works brilliantly, constantly updated, and free. Doesn't get any better than that. 
cgeo.geocaching#133495:	   Map doesnt work any moore pls fix Was 5 star 
cgeo.geocaching#133501:	   This was my favorite app for geocaching but now everytime I try to use it and it force closes ever few minutes and it won't load maps at all. This needs to be fixed or I'm going to need to find a new app. 
cgeo.geocaching#133504:	   App doesn't sync with online info. If someone logs a visit online instead of the app, it doesn't appear on the app. This causes double posts sometimes. 
cgeo.geocaching#133516:	   This app was awesome! It worked great and I was able to do all my geocaching with it. But the last few updates keep making it worse and worse. It doesn't even work anymore. I thought updates made apps better...not worse! Fix it and stop breaking it! 
cgeo.geocaching#133529:	   The best there is. Some people just don't get it. 
cgeo.geocaching#133542:	   So very happy c geo is back. Will give it 5 stars once I field test it and everything is ok. As of now I've only messed around with it to see if out worked or not. C geo wa the best before all the crashing and it seems to be back up and running again. 
cgeo.geocaching#133553:	   Live map is not loading I can see cached nearby but it won't show them on map. 
cgeo.geocaching#133557:	   Used to work great on Thunderbolt. After multiple crashes and extremely delayed loading og cache details I uninstalled after only 2 hours. 
cgeo.geocaching#133558:	   Used to love this app. Now it repeatedly crashes on live map. Very disappointed. 
cgeo.geocaching#133570:	   Im very happy with the recent updates now i have one issue i dont know if its my phone or the app but the logs are sync with the website logs DROIDX3 
cgeo.geocaching#133574:	   Most if not all problems come from Groundspeak who are constantly trying to break the app. They want to sell premium memberships and this is the only app that gives a similar functionality for free by pulling the data from the website and processing it. Thank them for the huge amount of work and fast updates or stfu. 
cgeo.geocaching#133576:	   I do hate that it doesn't work like it did a couple months ago but it is still the best app! I like to map out the easiest route (I take my grandkids most of the time) online...I simply "store" the ones I want to go to and voila! Love it! 
cgeo.geocaching#133587:	   This is the best gc app for the droid. Id say its better than the paid iphone app - load and log caches on the fly, no downloading needed. 
cgeo.geocaching#133594:	   Takes forever to load. Often can't find the cache....3 stars because it's free and does find some of them. 
cgeo.geocaching#133601:	   Worked fantastic until recent update broke it... Pls fix and ill change from 1 star 
cgeo.geocaching#133604:	   Does not work at all. 
cgeo.geocaching#133607:	   This app worked great but now the map will not work. This app is useless without the map. Please fix! 
cgeo.geocaching#133608:	   Why did you take away live map, it made looking for caches so much easier. The nearby function does not work on my HTC phone. Go back to the way it was before this update. 
cgeo.geocaching#133609:	   Droid Bionic. Was okay the first time I used it but now it keeps saying it failed to download the cache. It's not my connection because I tested it and it works fine. 
cgeo.geocaching#133617:	   Since the map is not working, this app is just half usefull. 
cgeo.geocaching#133621:	   I used to love this app and tell everyone about it. Ever since it went to open source, it has been flaky and now it doesn't work anymore on my phone. Too bad because i always used it. 
cgeo.geocaching#133623:	  Was good app but since the failure of live maps I find it tedious. Hope the c:geo team can sort out the API issue and get live maps up again. 
cgeo.geocaching#133630:	   If only live map wouldn't get all jumbled and show me caches I've already found but show unfound. 
cgeo.geocaching#133634:	   Previous version was brill but this is slow to load an keeps freezing. Will have to find an alternative till this app is fixed 
cgeo.geocaching#133636:	   All other features work fine but the live map has not worked for a while. Its a bit frustrating. Please figure out the issue so my sister and I may get back to caching! 
cgeo.geocaching#133638:	   Usually great app but from last update no live maps, and c geo crashes all the time. Miss it so much. 
cgeo.geocaching#133641:	  Love the app.I use it over any other geocaching apps.Only issue is under nearby search and compass the arrow shows opposite direction of actual cache. 
cgeo.geocaching#133647:	   Keeps freezing and live maps does not work. Please fix program does not work. On HTC evo 3d. 
cgeo.geocaching#133650:	   This app was great 5* but now it fails to login. When logging in the settings says login ok but in cgeo home page login failed. Also live map displays no cashes. 
cgeo.geocaching#133651:	   Live maps do not open at all. 
cgeo.geocaching#133654:	   I've used this app for over a year with few problems. After recently updating, it now locks up after a few minutes in Live Map, and phone has to be restarted to get things working again. Hoping for a fix soon. Droid RAZR MAXX 
cgeo.geocaching#133656:	   The map doesn't work, and it keeps crashing 
cgeo.geocaching#133657:	   This does not work on my brand new htc rezound. I had no issues with it on my 2 previous htc phones. 
cgeo.geocaching#133661:	   It's been forceclose a lot on me lately. Mostly when I want detail about a cache. Kind of ruins the fun when it keeps forceclose. Please fix because otherwise this app is the best for geocaching. 
cgeo.geocaching#133662:	   This is the best geocaching app I've tried. I've been using it for quite a while now and am very pleased with it. The accuracy of the compass is great and the convenience of being able to log your find is a must. Only problem is that it takes a while to load. This is great when I'm without my Garmin GPS. 
cgeo.geocaching#133670:	   I am having problems, iam premium member . I keep getting error mes , login failed, please some one help. 
cgeo.geocaching#133672:	   This app is a must have for me. The developers are quick to push out updates to fix problems and all for free! 
cgeo.geocaching#133675:	   I never write reviews, this is my first! But I had to rate this because of how much I use it and 'love' it! It has so many things I like to use. Easy to navigate through the app. I just realized that you can log you visit on site my hitting menu when viewing the Logbook. Love the detail of the maps. Much better than the geocaching web page. When there have been issues with the app, fixes where done via updates. I email the app developer and got a response, and the app was updated. Only app for me for GC. 
cgeo.geocaching#133680:	   Force close fix you posted totally worked. I was still freezing after the update until I saw your post. Now I am back to the fun! 
cgeo.geocaching#133681:	  Fab. The error has been fixed. Whooppee 
cgeo.geocaching#133682:	   I loved this app! Worked like a charm. But now it won't events load the caches. I can still navigate to them. But I can't see the description or anything. Its so frustrating and sad :( please fix! 
cgeo.geocaching#133685:	  Has it's share of problems, but I doubt an "unofficial" and free geocaching app could get any better than this. 
cgeo.geocaching#133687:	   but I have not been able to download a cache to it all day I keep getting the message "failed to download cache details." Can someone please tell me what is wrong it worked just fine yesterday? I am doing some research and it looks as if they know of issues so my review will be re-rated after all is fixed. 
cgeo.geocaching#133691:	   Installed first time and it would not download cache details no matter how many times I logged into my GC account successfully. Everything else seemed good including live map. Uninstalled and tried again and it works. Now all features are working, but takes a while to sort new caches according to distance, but I can live with that. Happy now :-) 
cgeo.geocaching#133693:	   Sorting in nearby caches is still not working properly for me :( ...even after update. @htc desire EDIT Now it finally works! Dunno what was the issue as I'm PM all the time... 
cgeo.geocaching#133694:	   The last two version are freezing my Galaxy S Plus when going to live maps. Otherwise a great application! Thanks and I'm waiting for the update that fix the issue. 
cgeo.geocaching#133700:	   Love this for geocaching and the support when it stops working is out standing. 
cgeo.geocaching#133707:	   The last few versions (including the current one) have been hanging/force closing when Live Map is selected. Changing from Google: Map to OSM: Mapnik in the Settings seemed to resolve this for me. Changing back to Google: Map afterwards worked again too, seemingly clearing the problem. HTH but YMMV. 
cgeo.geocaching#133710:	   After a day, after the proper geocache website updated this app now cannot open or store offline details...useless 
cgeo.geocaching#133711:	   I have always loved this app. Use it all the time and talk it up to all my smartphone cachers. Yesterday this worked great, would be 5 stars, but now it doesn't work. Distance in nearby is still wrong, won't refresh caches, and now I can't even load new ones.  soon!!! 
cgeo.geocaching#133712:	   This app worked ok for a while. Some things like sorting by distance and showing all caches in a given area don't work so well. Today it stopped working all together (I guess the corporate guys finally cracked down). 
cgeo.geocaching#133713:	   Stopped working after a few uses. Used to be fun. Bummer. Please fix for droid x2. 
cgeo.geocaching#133714:	   App won't load any new caches or refresh stored ones. :( I hope it will be solved soon. 
cgeo.geocaching#133716:	  Was great.latest update has rendered useless. Please fix. HTC wf-s 
cgeo.geocaching#133717:	   Was once a near perfect app...now it literally does not work at all. 
cgeo.geocaching#133719:	   Live map broken on DROID Razor. Always been an awesome app though. Please fix live map. 
cgeo.geocaching#133727:	   Update causes the app to crash and the OS to be very unstable when you enter live maps. 
cgeo.geocaching#133729:	   Since the new version came out it keeps crashing my thunderbolt.... Now useless 
cgeo.geocaching#133730:	   Having problems with live maps. Maybe it will work on next update. This is a great free app that allows you to find geos on the go. 
cgeo.geocaching#133735:	   Having issues with the live map and nearby search. Reinstalling. Used to love this ap. We'll see what happens....HTC Evo 
cgeo.geocaching#133750:	   It's was great untill the last update force closes everytime now. Please fix 
cgeo.geocaching#133751:	   Loved it before. Now love map crashes my SGS2 
cgeo.geocaching#133754:	   my download stops @94% - I like the app but now doesnt work tried to reinstall and this - please fix 
cgeo.geocaching#133761:	   I really liked this app until the last update. Now it hangs and force closes any time I select live map. Fix it and it's back to 5 stars. 
cgeo.geocaching#133769:	   Why do filters not work and live map is not reliable. 
cgeo.geocaching#133774:	   This worked well prior to the most recent update. Now won't load, and continually forces close. Have uninstalled. Not pleased as it worked so well. My one star is generous. Please fix asap. 
cgeo.geocaching#133782:	   The last update was great, got maps back. This update does not work only wants to force close. Tried uninstall and install, even slower to find satellites. Was a ten rating now a one. please fix! Droid x 
cgeo.geocaching#133787:	   Thank you for the fix. It appears to be working now. HTC Incredible 2 
cgeo.geocaching#133788:	   HELP!!!!!!!!!! I had to reformat my phone, which also mental that I needed to reinstall this app. Now even I try to log on, it keeps saying "unknown error" how do I fix this???? I tried it three diff days. 
cgeo.geocaching#133810:	   Occasional crash on my revolution. No big deal. Live maps works well. And when did translate logs appear? Links directly to my Google translate app 
cgeo.geocaching#133813:	   Best caching app for Android and it's free. 5 stars even when live map was not working. Now it would be six :) 
cgeo.geocaching#133829:	   This app has all the features and more then the official. It's easier to use and is updated more often. I even sold my GPS as I don't use it anymore! 
cgeo.geocaching#133830:	   Best app I have on my phone again. Great fix. 
cgeo.geocaching#133844:	   Great app, had to set up over my Wi-Fi as it wouldn't find cache locations from the top of a mountain, but hey after saving the caches it works like a charm. Almost as good as being a pirate finding buried treasure xD 
cgeo.geocaching#133847:	   Generally works well but a few bugs. Caches randomly disappearing from lists and maps, force closes. Cant always rely on it but still good. Dev is very helpful and responds to emails. 
cgeo.geocaching#133855:	   My phone hasn't loaded a single cache so it sucks 
cgeo.geocaching#133861:	   For fixing live maps. 5 stars when live maps shows all caches around me and in correct places. 
cgeo.geocaching#133863:	   Only problem I have is that you can't store your own waypoints or enter in manual co-ordinates (or at least I can't find a way...?) a bit problematic for multi/puzzle caches etc. but for straightforward traditional caches it's absolutely brilliant. Still giving it 5 stars, as for a free app it's still fantastic. 
cgeo.geocaching#133868:	   This is my first time geocaching with a smartphone. I the app did everything I wanted. I could search for and filter caches booth nearby and at another location. I had it give me turn-by-turn driving directions, then switched to map view after I parked. Not all the functions are obvious. If you don't find the function you want, check the menu. It was nearly as accurate as my hiking GPS and a lot easier to use. 
cgeo.geocaching#133876:	   With live map back, I have no hesitation rating this as one if the best apps out there. Had been waiting for the fix for a while and with it here, I can now get back to caching. Thanks!!!!! 
cgeo.geocaching#133900:	   Excellent now the live map is fixed :-) 
cgeo.geocaching#133912:	   Ok at least the live map shows live caches now once you click on a cache you are intrested in it will shop precise cords. Good fix still toils like to see a symbol for dnf caches 
cgeo.geocaching#133924:	   Killer work with the fix. We appreciate it! 
cgeo.geocaching#133940:	   Awesome app. Glad to have live map back, but one issue, shows found caches as well, kinda bothersome i do have the hide found caches turned on. Please fix also having a slight issue identifying the type of cache. Maybe my settings, i will check, hopin thats it 
cgeo.geocaching#133944:	   Was and still is the best geocaching app. Thanks for the live maps fix. Super... 
cgeo.geocaching#133953:	   Live map fixed and faster than before! 
cgeo.geocaching#133962:	   Great, but since live maps died, it has become less useful. Why not use openstreetmaps??? 
cgeo.geocaching#133963:	   Last update made the "live map" no longer work. It no longer live updates. Please fix it. This program is the best I have tried. 
cgeo.geocaching#133979:	   Great app since I just started geo cacheing. Only problem is that my live map will not show any caches on it. 
cgeo.geocaching#133982:	   Even without the live map, this still beats out the official geocaching app! Their app sucks!!! And they charge for it!!! You guys do some good work. Even if you can't fix for this map update, we thank you for what you have done and appreciate your effort! 
cgeo.geocaching#133986:	   : ( I hope you can fix live map soon. It's impossible to road trip and cache practically without it. 
cgeo.geocaching#133993:	   Have been using this app instead of buying the other one from the geocaching site. This app always works. Never any issues. I LOVE it!!! It is probably better than the one u have to pay for. 
cgeo.geocaching#133994:	   Has work great, nice gui.. the new errors related to using geocatching,com's info on a live map are unforunate, but I'm sure a fix will come soon. When it was working as designed, it was a dream. Be patient it will be back. 
cgeo.geocaching#134003:	  Worked nicely earlier but since last update it tends to crash and bug more. 
cgeo.geocaching#134026:	   I used this on my droid to find a cache on my lunch break. I did not use live map, but it does show the location on a map so you know where to start and the easy to use compass can take you from there. It pulled up all nearby caches, and I could easily view details. This is an amazing free app! 
cgeo.geocaching#134027:	   See its not just the issue with the live map for some reason this app places me several miles off and it likes to shut off on its own I will be freeing up space on my phone this will be one of the first things to go now that I got my garmin oregon 450 geocaching is way better again just gotta plug in to the computer and load the caches that way ohh well thanks for the crappy update 
cgeo.geocaching#134034:	   It would be nice if live maps problem gets resolved. 
cgeo.geocaching#134052:	   Used to be the best app for geocaching, now it's junk. Doesn't sort of correctly, live map doesn't work, random geocaches not showing 
cgeo.geocaching#134061:	   When you fix the live map, I'll change my rating. 
cgeo.geocaching#134062:	   I found if you load 80 nearby by caches will traveling you can still navigate and zoom to where you want to search if you click the square box up top. I have less problems with the satellite loading maps this way 
cgeo.geocaching#134063:	  Please fix soon! I had to pay for the "official" geocaching app. I don't like it. Please fix this one! 
cgeo.geocaching#134064:	   I agree... This app is very clumsy to navigate without the live app. It's hard to figure out which cache is closest to me, and I can't remember the names of the caches I've plan to find in the future. I used to use it a lot, but I don't anymore. I hope they can fix this soon! 
cgeo.geocaching#134065:	   Don't use any more! 
cgeo.geocaching#134068:	   What is wrong with you one/two star reviewers? Not dev's fault that stuff isn't working properly. Figure out your facts before you bash a great program 
cgeo.geocaching#134078:	   You guys, it is not c:geo's fault that the live map doesn't work. They didn't Choose to take it out. If anything its groundspeaks fault. Stop giving it bad reviews this is still the best app out there and hopefully someday it'll work again. 
cgeo.geocaching#134083:	   The reason Live Maps is not working is NOT c.geo fault. They posted a notice to you when you got your update. They don't like it any more than you or I. Be patient they will come up with a solution. 
cgeo.geocaching#134085:	   Used it yesterday while out and about. Found a list of nearest caches. Navigated to the cache I wanted. Logged as found. Don't blame c:geo for the lack of maps. Direct your anger at Groundspeak. Their maps don't work as they should either. Go check their forums. this IS still the best geocaching app around. And it's free you whiners! 
cgeo.geocaching#134100:	   Sure the live map isn't working but app still works great. Just know what your looking for or use the nearby function 
cgeo.geocaching#134108:	   This was a great app, but now is pretty much useless without the live map. Hope it gets fixed soon. 
cgeo.geocaching#134109:	   I know its not the developers fault. But this app is broken. Groundspeak broke it. But i can not justify keeping a 5 star rating on something that dose not work. I will keep a 3 star because you can still use pq to find caches and logging function still works. I hope to one day be able to give app 5 stars again. It was by far the best caching app out there. Until the greedy Groundspeak broke it. Thanks for all the hard work on the application. even broken it is still far better then the official app. 
cgeo.geocaching#134117:	  Its a waste I can't use this it sucks now! 
cgeo.geocaching#134125:	   I understand it's not your fault with the API issue but without live map the app is useless to me. Still, it served me well so 3 stars. 
cgeo.geocaching#134129:	   If you click on any destination and tell it to use your location (my coordinates) then search, it will show all caches around that location. That is the best fix that I have been able to find! 
cgeo.geocaching#134130:	   I loved the live map feature, but not c.go's fault its gone. Find nearby doesn't work for me all the time, says im somewhere else. Oh well VIVA LA LIVE MAP!!! 
cgeo.geocaching#134138:	   Went to use the live map today to check out some geocaches in an area and guess what it don't work. Please work on bring the live map back. Bummed big time 
cgeo.geocaching#134149:	   When did people forget how to read information? The problem is not c:geos fault. Yes losing live maps is a bummer, hopefully a workaround can be found, until then try a little forward planning, I spent 10 mins using the send to c:geo function on the site and had a very successful caching day. Stop moaning about something that is out of the developers hands and be grateful that they continue to put in their time to make a FREE app for you. 
cgeo.geocaching#134155:	   Still a great app! Blame groundspeak for issues, not c:geo. They are the reason for the issues! !! 
cgeo.geocaching#134158:	   Used to love this app up until they updated it to which I can't see caches on the live map only if I stored them. But what if there are new caches what then!?! I just won't be able to know. What if i go to a new place what then??! 5 stars to 1 star.!! I would put 0 stars but its not available..now I have no use for this app! Uninstall! I would pay to bring back the old version!! Please bring it back ! 
cgeo.geocaching#134161:	   But live maps gone and nearby search doesn't work anymore. 
cgeo.geocaching#134165:	   Was my go to app for geocaching. Not useable now. I'll reinstall when live map is added back. 
cgeo.geocaching#134168:	   This is a fantastic app for caching but had to drop one star due to problems, no doubt they will fix, then back to 5 out of 5. Thanks guys. 
cgeo.geocaching#134169:	   You need to fix the live map. Make it show all the caches again I instead of just the ones I have saved. Now im going to be forced to look for another geo app. 
cgeo.geocaching#134177:	   Great fix...no caches on map, no nearby caches, nothing on search! What was the point of "fixing" a great program so it doesn't work at all?? 
cgeo.geocaching#134180:	   I have used this app for years, only because of this feature. Please fix or I will have no choice but to move on and say goodbye like thousands of fellow cachers that utilize this app. :-( 
cgeo.geocaching#134185:	   This app used to work a few months ago, now it just sucks! (FCs, no live map,...) Please fix it. 
cgeo.geocaching#134188:	   No use without live map,boo. Great until now 
cgeo.geocaching#134195:	   Live map not working Please fix 
cgeo.geocaching#134197:	   I've been having the same trouble with the live maps. I tried uninstalling then reinstalling the app from the market, but live map still won't show caching site. Please fix asap. 
cgeo.geocaching#134199:	   In the last week I have not been able to use the live map. "It is only able to download partial data." It does not load any data for the caches, just a map. What has happened? It was working great until recently. 
cgeo.geocaching#134200:	   App works great on my Android phone when the app is working. Recently the app does not show caches on the live view. You can only search by nearby caches and then look up each one to find the location. Please fix asap. 
cgeo.geocaching#134201:	   Live map doesn't work OS Map is good feature though Struggles on HTC Sensation XE 
cgeo.geocaching#134202:	   This app stop working two days ago But it was great! Please, fix this. 
cgeo.geocaching#134204:	   App worked great before, but now it keeps telling me it can only download partial data and it won't display any caches! Had it not been for the internet download service for Chrome my caching day would have been ruined. Please fix asap! 
cgeo.geocaching#134205:	   You need to post an update that you are fixing this app...at least I hope you are it does not work anymore . Live map does not display anything. 
cgeo.geocaching#134207:	   Recently updated and live maps will not load any caches. Says only partial data was able to download. Please fix, I used to love this app. 
cgeo.geocaching#134208:	   Caches not loading on map. 
cgeo.geocaching#134210:	   Groundspeak recently update the map on the regular webpage. Since that time this app doesn't populate the cache on the map. I use this all the time when caching Please fix. Thanks 
cgeo.geocaching#134212:	   Was great plz fix. 
cgeo.geocaching#134213:	   This app has been great, just as good as the expensive groundspeak app i paid for on my old phone. But has stopped loaded caches two days ago. Please fix this. 
cgeo.geocaching#134214:	  This app has always served me well, and RIGHT WHEN I GO ON MY TRIP it stops loading caches... -_- 
cgeo.geocaching#134215:	   I love this app, I use this app for 98% of my caching, but it's now not working, this needs a fix real quick. 
cgeo.geocaching#134216:	   I really like this app for grabbing a quick cache or two. But since the update the caches dont show up on the map. This was actually my favorite feature of this app. I hope they can fix it soon. 
cgeo.geocaching#134217:	   Normally very dependable app, but stopped working a few days ago. Four stars till updated! 
cgeo.geocaching#134218:	   I love using this app but since they updated the geocache website it is not working right. App needs update too 
cgeo.geocaching#134220:	   Just discovered this on Monday. I got 1 day with it. Please fix live map 
cgeo.geocaching#134221:	   Just like 2 other users, mine was also stopped working, it wont load any caches. Please fix it soon!! Other than that, it's usually a great app. :) 
cgeo.geocaching#134222:	   Just like a previous reviewer,irely on this appto helpwith most of my geocaching and have found it to be great help but now there are no caches loading up once again. What is going on? Fix please 
cgeo.geocaching#134235:	   This app works great! I've never had any issues with it. 
cgeo.geocaching#134252:	  I've used this app for almost 2 years. I love it! Lately I can't get it to update via WiFi and don't have 3G in Afghanistan, so its not useable atm 
cgeo.geocaching#134258:	   The Google map update fixed the god issue I was having before update map showed me 2-5 miles from where I was. But now the sorting is not working on EVO 
cgeo.geocaching#134260:	   I was a bit concerned about the permissions with the app. I sent an email to the programmer and received a response within hours. Even better, he said they would address the issue in the next update. The program continues to be great. Thanks! 
cgeo.geocaching#134262:	   A few annoying bugs, but really excellent value for no money ;) 
cgeo.geocaching#134267:	   I don't use my gamin anymore because this is so easy to find caches near me. No more planning ahead of time. Not a perfect gps, but does the job. 
cgeo.geocaching#134272:	  Would have given 5 stars but these last few days my locations have been wwwaaayyyyy off. Before the location issue, this app was perfect! 
cgeo.geocaching#134274:	   I really don't geocache enough, I probably should use this more while its winter and all the bugs and weeds are dead. This takes what is already a cool concept and turns it up to 11. 
cgeo.geocaching#134283:	   Great app. Appreciated by many cachers for remaining free. I would have more confidence in it if your website didn't have so many spelling errors. One can only hope the code for this app is checked more throughly. Just a thought. 
cgeo.geocaching#134293:	  The latest update rocks. I completely uninstalled tho befits reinstalling as I was having freezing problems. A complete reinstall is always good :) 
cgeo.geocaching#134318:	   Show near by not working 
cgeo.geocaching#134331:	   Continually crashing on sgs2. Used to work fantastically! 
cgeo.geocaching#134335:	   Downloaded application and had log in issues. Once that got worked out it looks like I am back to caching! Recovanreco 
cgeo.geocaching#134340:	   It won't download cache details. Forces close. HTC sensation. Used to be awesome though 
cgeo.geocaching#134348:	  Worth 5 stars when working correctly. Keeps crashing on current update though. 
cgeo.geocaching#134361:	  Not working 
cgeo.geocaching#134362:	   I've tried several and this is hands down the best. A bit of a learning curve, but I am now completely paperless. Do yourself a favor and get this, play with it, read the manual and also get the GCC app. Send2c:geo is also nice to send a cache right to your phone. That is everything you will ever need besides a pen. Don't forget to donate; this deserves it. 
cgeo.geocaching#134367:	   From making list for offline to logging travel bugs, this app really does do it all. The only thing I can't find how to do is let you place geocaches. 
cgeo.geocaching#134369:	   This is a great app, and by all accounts better than the official one. Can force close sometimes, has issues with live search, and for some reason 'caches near me' takes about 10 years to load up. But for free, it's superb. 
cgeo.geocaching#134371:	   Best app EVER! Gave away my garmen legend to a fellow newbie cacher when I found this app. Only had issues 2 or 3 times & I use it 4-5 days a week :) 
cgeo.geocaching#134387:	   It might just be my phone but it takes to long to download info page, and its giving me problems posting visits. Other than that its great. 
cgeo.geocaching#134388:	  Loved this app until I updated. Now it won't open. Immediately force closes. 
cgeo.geocaching#134391:	   When it works. This app has everything I ever needed to find a cache. Love offline mode and the navigate to feature but recently has been crashing. 
cgeo.geocaching#134395:	   This app had been brilliant for me and I had been so pleased with it but lately it's crashing a lot (even since the latest update) and loading takes forever, even with 5 bars. As for opening a cache log...argh!!! Please get it working as well as it was as it was brilliant. 
cgeo.geocaching#134404:	   i can't find something to complain about. 
cgeo.geocaching#134406:	   Wouldn't use anything else 
cgeo.geocaching#134421:	   even better that it's free. fast bug fixes too 
cgeo.geocaching#134429:	   Sometimes has problems with jumping around on the map..but other then that I love cgeo 
cgeo.geocaching#134437:	   I've tried several caching apps and this is by far the best. Developers are active and respond quickly with bug fixes when needed. Thanks! 
cgeo.geocaching#134442:	   Love this app even though it's not the "official" app. Fast response when they find a bug. 
cgeo.geocaching#134443:	   This used to rock, but most recent update broke it. No longer opens without error and can't re-install either. I'll miss this app.. desire froyo 2.2 
cgeo.geocaching#134454:	  Unable to log finds. Get an error 
cgeo.geocaching#134456:	   Fantastic app. Had some force close issues after last update which were fixed by deleting the data cache. So anyone else with fc's should try that :-)
