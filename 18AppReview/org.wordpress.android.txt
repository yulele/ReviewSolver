org.wordpress.android#100003:	  I love the convenience and simplicity of this app! Only downside is you can't upload star points from grocery items, you have to go to the website (but it instructs you to do so on the star point, so it didn't affect my rating) 
org.wordpress.android#100007:	  Love Wordpress,HATE this app. You're literally just better off using your browser to do everything. Adding a self hosted site is always a problem signing in. 
org.wordpress.android#100009:	  Very slowly not fast very poor.... Not show big size photo.... Big problem is Low option..... Please fixed the problem and update 
org.wordpress.android#100016:	  Useless this not synchronize your post, and don't work correctly. 
org.wordpress.android#100018:	  I am so disappointed in this app. I thought it was just a data error but my work as not saved! Can you fix this bug please? How can I automatically sync my work so that I can see it on the website? Please get a straighforward support tool as well its so confusing! 
org.wordpress.android#100038:	  I would have given it a better rating if I could upload images fast as I write my posts. Uploading takes ages despite fast internet connection (because pc version gets the images uploaded readily so I know its the app's fault) Fix it soon otherwise there will be more people giving bad reviews. 
org.wordpress.android#100039:	  Nothing works. It's all "can't be reached at this time". I have 2 sites and it only displays 1. Too many bugs, keep working on it. 
org.wordpress.android#100040:	  Does not work with several popular comment subscription plugins. If a blog has comment moderation enabled, and then an administrator replies to (and thereby approves) a comment which is "pending moderation" from within this app, the comment author will never get the reply notification email. This is because this app appears to somehow bypass the `wp_set_comment_status` hook when administrators reply to a "pending moderation" comment within the app. The `wp_set_comment_status` hook is what fires the reply notification emails for many comment subscription plugins. There is a clue that the developers know of this bug (I do see it as a bug) because, in this app, an administrator can "Reply" to comment that is pending moderation, but in the regular WP Admin interface, the button is labeled "Approve and Reply" not just "Reply." I hope this gets fixed as it would be great to use this app to approve and reply to comments, and fire the `wp_set_comment_status` hook so that comment authors can receive email notification of the replies. 
org.wordpress.android#100042:	  Thought it wasn't working so I have it a bag review, but it turned out that one of my plugins was not allowing the app to connect to my site. 
org.wordpress.android#100056:	  I can't log into my account using this app or the browser. Not even create a new one. There's always an error or site cannot be reached. 
org.wordpress.android#100067:	  I love writing and I have used WordPress for a long time now but after the recent update I cannot find anything. The editor doesn't contain strike-through option; neither the read more tag. The pages load slowly Please fix this. Thank you 
org.wordpress.android#100077:	  This app is so buggy it fails at basic text and uploading pictures 
org.wordpress.android#100079:	  I can't add my own site, can't upload my pictures. The whole app is confusing and yet they make it seem simple. 
org.wordpress.android#100098:	  Thanks for the quick response from the developer. Will follow the developers recommendations and contact support via email. Will update my review based on how the issue is resolved. 
org.wordpress.android#100103:	  Always says 403 forbidden. what happened? I can't open my account! I have already linked it to my gmail, but nothing happened always says 403 error 
org.wordpress.android#100107:	  I blog every day and this lets me post when I am lazy. Also useful for reading my posts, I am a poet. Unfortunately, today it's just not loading at all. Super frustrating when I blog everyday. I just did the post on Facebook but I hope the issue gets resolved. May be due to a recent update. Reinstalling after the issue is continuing. 
org.wordpress.android#100108:	  Absolute dog crap. Uploading pictures might as well take a century if they work at all. The formatting gets completely messed up if you don't use HTML, but I can never switch to HTML because the photo uploads which never finish block me from doing so. App crashes every 5 minutes and has numerous glitches. Very, very disappointed as I love the WordPress platform and was counting on this app for a blog I was doing while traveling but it did not work at all. Extremely unimpressed. 1/5. Would be 1/10 if I could give it such a rating. 
org.wordpress.android#100116:	  I loved the idea of it. Unfortunately I ran into a headaches worth of problems. When you contact them, no One answers leaving you stuck and frustrated 
org.wordpress.android#100117:	  Pretty good. Sometimes have issues with the photos, but fixable. 
org.wordpress.android#100118:	  I would give five star but after 3 days when I make links n click it disappear wtf fix it 
org.wordpress.android#100122:	  Cant publish any post because of error. Sorry if it is my phone. But can't find any problem with my phone. 
org.wordpress.android#100124:	  App spying on me!!! When I click on an image from the attachment screen. app says "cannot load attachment". But some ip in Washington Virginia immediately hits my site for the same image. Why??? 
org.wordpress.android#100130:	  I love blogging but I am having certain issues with this app...Someone recommended me WordPress and I installed it...But how could people around the globe would be able to see my blogs and how could I follow blogging sites..Well I am definitely having various issues... i hope you people could help me out..I joined today and I posted my first blog 
org.wordpress.android#100137:	  A nice app, but I m using Vietnamese for almost my posts, so I found out some issue related to font. I hope it will be fixed soon, thanks WP team. 
org.wordpress.android#100141:	  I made sites for people using custom fields normally and this does not work via this app which makes it next to useless for me. 
org.wordpress.android#100144:	  Hi WordPress team. Can I report the web page related issue here? 
org.wordpress.android#100154:	  At least give us choice to choose whether we should go to external browser or in the app itself to view admin dashboard. I know some options doesn't work fine in App but whatever options were there on the older version of the app was quite helpful. Please give us the in app dashboard. 
org.wordpress.android#100159:	   Three things plague this app for me. 1-You cannot upload on the featured image button, you have to do that on the main screen of the site. 2-You cannot get the edit post link through the app, have to log into dashboard on a browser. I need these links to submit post to my editor through Slack or Trello. 3-There is no word count visible. I need that since the sites I write for have a minimum word count. All three of these would make this a five star app for me, else it is useless for me and I might as well just write through the browser. 
org.wordpress.android#100170:	  Nice app but problem is with browsing the old posts. Since we are on mobile, you can expect faster connectivity, so featured image on post should be disabled. I was not even able to browse older posts even when the phone is connected to a highspeed WiFi. 
org.wordpress.android#100178:	  There is a problem when save the drafts and crashes everytime while writing 
org.wordpress.android#100180:	  Can't upload pic at all, still 
org.wordpress.android#100181:	  Photo uploading is decidedly broken. The multi picker works great, but it is a coin toss whether each individual photo will upload successfully or hang at 80% and go nowhere. The only way to fix hung uploads is to delete it and then browse through your photos again to try once more. This is a huge burden when you upload 20 photos and 5 of them hang. This behavior is consistent whether on wifi or data. What's more, the only intuitive options for a poat are "local draft" or "publish". I can't get the app to default to "draft", in which it is uploaded and able to be edited on my computer. Even if I only have the app as a way to upload cell photos, it is almost worthless at that. 
org.wordpress.android#100193:	  No other blog website come close to WordPress IMO. Beautiful themes easy to work. And a great user interface. All in all I wouldn't use any other blog site. 
org.wordpress.android#100195:	  Hey the app is not logging me in. It wasn't uploading my posts either. I don't know what the problem is. 
org.wordpress.android#100196:	  I don't use auto correct but I do use auto caps, auto spacing, next word prediction and smart editor. Maybe one of these options could also have this error? 
org.wordpress.android#100198:	  Don't get me wrong, I love wp. Trouble is this Android app crashes every time, 2 seconds after opening. Just can't get it to work. 
org.wordpress.android#100199:	  My second time over the last 12 months trying this app. Still cannot log in to my self hosted site. Multiple attempts with correct name, pass and url leads to "we can't log you in" error. Uninstalling again. 
org.wordpress.android#100201:	  Lots of problems here...I'm unable to customize my page... 
org.wordpress.android#100207:	  Lots of bugs with the editor. My post went online with no tags and no categories, and the app doesn't even let me try to fix it. 
org.wordpress.android#100220:	  Still takes 4-5 times to upload the pics. Pls fix it.. 
org.wordpress.android#100225:	  it just won't open,i am pressing button like crazy but nothing,i have acer liquid zest. 
org.wordpress.android#100240:	  Horrible bug in this. If there are multiple editors who have password blogs, unlocking one unlocks them all despite different passwords. Even if you clear the cache and force stop. This is a WRETCHED big that needs to be fixed. Deleted because of this crap. 
org.wordpress.android#100247:	  I can login successfully but unable to switch between my sites and only shows a blank dashboard. Is there any workaround on this issue? Thanks 
org.wordpress.android#100250:	  App crashes every time I try to open my site from the app. Kinda pointless the this point... Update: got good support, issue now resolved 
org.wordpress.android#100252:	  I just updated then I can't find my drafts. I'm writing Week In The Life everyday and post it every Saturday. So I write and save and write again and save again. Now after I updated, all the drafts I have are gone. Where can I find it? Please help. Thanks. 
org.wordpress.android#100255:	  It's really addictive, it keeps me up all night. You can't get anywhere without spending $5 but other than that it's awesome. Seriously though, I like this blogging app. No problems across the board. 
org.wordpress.android#100260:	  Overall performance is good but sometimes it does not load all the blog posts. Takes lot of time to load older posts,only shows new posts. Also add an option to highlight text with colours. 
org.wordpress.android#100296:	  Can not open my account 
org.wordpress.android#100302:	  Pretty pointless. Can't log in and when you do you can't post anything or even view existing posts. The fact they have to point you in the direction of the Android Forum 'for help using this app' says it all. If it diesn't work in the first place - don't release it. Have now uninstalled it  ... 
org.wordpress.android#100308:	  Blog post, Error code 403 
org.wordpress.android#100312:	  Login error. 
org.wordpress.android#100341:	  Wish it would work but can not get it to match my password to my account 
org.wordpress.android#100349:	  Only problem is how it always disconnects from Facebook. Every once in a while, I have to go in and reconnect it and it's annoying. I'd appreciate it if that bug or whatever gets fixed. Other than that, I am satisfied. 
org.wordpress.android#100363:	  I can't upload a pdf unless I go to the website and since many of my updates involve uploading minutes from meetings and other pdf documents it makes the app impossible for me to use 
org.wordpress.android#100367:	  I love this app. I've never encountered any issues and although I blog infrequently, the bulk of each entry is usually written on my mobile during an opportune moment of inspiration. I'd use it more if I posted more, it's straightforward, well laid-out and presented. It may be my favourite app. 
org.wordpress.android#100377:	  Please make it a feature to find draft post. I couldn't find my draft post 
org.wordpress.android#100383:	   If we want to change profile picture we can't use Gallery now. Why? So? There should be a method to upload photo from gallery. 
org.wordpress.android#100395:	   It progress my working but sometimes it cause error message "Unfortunatelly Wordppress has stop" but my phone is able to use much high function. 
org.wordpress.android#100405:	   Images stop uploading 90% of the way through, drafts do not update, and putting breaks between paragraphs doesn't work. Needs work. 
org.wordpress.android#100425:	  Site Not Open 
org.wordpress.android#100428:	  Can't post to my ISP-hosted WordPress blog. Get 404 Errors. Can't even pull the drafts off my tablet easily. -- Update: Managed to install a plug in that worked, but lost all my local drafts. 
org.wordpress.android#100429:	   I am using it high speed connection even then uploading a small size image takes more than half an hour . Similarly post publishing takes a lot of time . App is of no use! 
org.wordpress.android#100433:	   Why the Featured Image feature is not working? I set a photo as a featured photo, but when I try to publish it on my facebook, other photo came up as featured photo. I did all troubleshooting I could possibly do, but still the same. It's annoying me. 
org.wordpress.android#100438:	   Twice now I've spent an hour writing a post, on a crappy edge connection (while on vacation) and then it deletes them. At random. No explanation, no way to undo or see a previous version. Utter trash. Needs a local database that saves different versions as you write and so when this horrifying problem occurs, I can roll back the post to a version before it deleted every friggen thing in it. Never using this app again. I cant trust it. I've just wasted two hours of battery life on it. 
org.wordpress.android#100449:	   i don't find any option to install s.. 
org.wordpress.android#100454:	   Was fine for years, now I get a 421 error when I try to upload posts or edits. Useless. 
org.wordpress.android#100458:	   I use wordpress for my podcast. It's pretty silly I can upload video but can't upload an mp3. Please fix this and then I will adjust my rating to 5 stars. 
org.wordpress.android#100470:	   Not user friendly 
org.wordpress.android#100472:	  Good app! Easy to use and follow. There's this sorta bug(?) when I make a scheduled post and try to revert it back to an immediate post though. ;_; EDIT: When I tried posting it as an immediate post, it wasn't showing up in the home page and it says the post isn't found when I tried copy pasting the URL directly to a browser. I had to delete the post and make a new one, and copy paste the content to post it. Hope this helps! 
org.wordpress.android#100474:	   I can't login to my self hosted blog. How to login? 
org.wordpress.android#100481:	   They all have common problems like posts being deleted randomly, posts not being published, etc. I am about to continue blogging in my tablet but it seems that all I read are negative reviews. 
org.wordpress.android#100493:	   Try to open site but not work 
org.wordpress.android#100500:	   Continue getting error 
org.wordpress.android#100502:	   It's was a nice app but now it doesn't open... 
org.wordpress.android#100504:	   Amazing progress programmers.Loads exceptionally speedy  Publish button vanishes after back button used,and page returns to wp home.No biggy but a timing issue maybe.Nice to see publish button added to main blog page. 
org.wordpress.android#100511:	   Fully foul. Can't access my any of website. Peoples are giving fake reviews. Ignore this foul app 
org.wordpress.android#100513:	   Why?? The upload photo stopped at 90% uploading progress for hours, i have stable internet connection, but it wont be uploaded, i tried repeatedly, but the uploading progress always stopped at 90%. why? Please fix this 
org.wordpress.android#100534:	   Used this APP for over 3 years without any major issues. 
org.wordpress.android#100536:	   Couldn't login to self-hosted site, but uninstalling and reinstalling fixed it. 
org.wordpress.android#100551:	   Can't moderate comments stays on pending also can't load gravatar warning. 
org.wordpress.android#100555:	  This app is so bright it hurts. You're trying to read, write and relax, but the blank color scheme reminds me more of the sun hitting my face at 6am than of me relaxing while browsing. This app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example, instead all we get is the "discover" feature which only promotes bland, vague and uninteresting posts with no personality. Just look at it right now! Where are the people sharing relatable stories, or video game strategies, or book or tv show reviews or something? All the posts featured there are just... unattractive, to say the least. And it's the only source of new content there is, otherwise you have to look it up manually. There are no set categories or tags, instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post, which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers. People can disapprove or even edit your comments. That is twisted, discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want. You can't dislike posts or comments, so the voting system is pointless. You might think otherwise because Twitter and Vine have no downvotes, but they promote discovery of new content in various ways, while WordPress does not. The search bar doesn't work. I've tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they don't appear. All of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community, and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on WordPress. Also there used to be a eay to add a black outline to images; a necessity when the background is white. 
org.wordpress.android#100570:	   Unable to upload images on my mobile that I have been using for months. When I tried on my tablet, it says something about a new way to upload an image and it worked. There is no such message on my mobile. The only message is "unfortunately WordPress has stopped working". 
org.wordpress.android#100571:	   I turned on notifications but I don't get em... 
org.wordpress.android#100580:	   Turns out the problem was with my Website provider. Thanks to very responsive help from them and from the WordPress help desk it's all solved now. ==== cut here==== I haven't found any way of getting "Local Changes" actually published. Gone through all the motions, chosen "Publish" from the "Publish/Revert" option. Nothing. The app isn't of much use without this... 
org.wordpress.android#100586:	   This is really bugging me because it means I have to use a less convenient method to upload images for a header. Please fix. 
org.wordpress.android#100589:	  Please fix the font when type Vietnamese 
org.wordpress.android#100592:	   Easy to use, after update app i cant approve and reply comments. Please fix it for 5 star 
org.wordpress.android#100594:	   Hi, whenever I try to publish a post, I am getting failure message. An error occurred while uploading the post HTTP status code 405 was returned. Method not allowed. And search image option while setting featured image will be helpful. 
org.wordpress.android#100599:	  I have been on the computer since 1991 Microsoft 2.3 and am practiced not template design building pages...slowly spent hours to work trial and error. These free and even subscribed Web builders are difficult to apply Mostly due to memory limitations. ... I find WordPress very proactive and useful Save Publish Edit Action These need better position and simpler explanations Thank you P's. I am 75 years old 
org.wordpress.android#100606:	   I can't login in into the app . It's say password is incorrect. 
org.wordpress.android#100609:	  publish slowly. Always fail uploading by 3g 
org.wordpress.android#100625:	  I can not login my site 
org.wordpress.android#100638:	   Cannot login if 2fact auth is activated. 
org.wordpress.android#100639:	   Solved the bug issue... Nice support.... 
org.wordpress.android#100666:	   Can't upload videos 
org.wordpress.android#100670:	  Even though I tried this with different keyboards it's editing capabilies are poor. They don't come up to any of the external editors that I have on my tablet. Compared to the pc/web version this is crippled. One reason I would like an external editor is that I have a lot more formatting capability and the ability to 'snapshot' or, for example, undo deletions. rather than sweat coding more editor functions, simply flipping into an more capable external editor seems sensible. There are a lot of management features in the PC/web version that I consider very basic. being able to edit the raw HTML code to correct errors or carry out formatting that the 'visual' mode doesn't permit is one. Again, this might be resolved with an external editor: edit in visual/text or in html switch. Perhaps the simplest demonstration of what's lacking is to run the tablet and the PC/web version side by side. I realize there is a screen real estate issue, especially when trying to run this on a 4.5 inch phone, but perhaps that's a case of "you shouldn't be doing that". However other applications I use do have panels that pull down or pull in from the side. ... out of space ... 
org.wordpress.android#100671:	   Kitkat RAM 512 quardcore ARM 7 neon Problem unfortunately stop plz fix this problem i already send report 
org.wordpress.android#100678:	   I rely very heavily on this app to keep me posted about notifications because for some reason, the website doesn't do it as quickly on neither my laptop nor my desktop. But of late, I've noticed, there have been glitches in the app too. Like gravatars of other bloggers get mixed up. I get a notification on my lock screen that I've received a like or comment l, but when I open the app, it doesn't show me the latest notification. There are other too. Please fix these issues. 
org.wordpress.android#100680:	   This app has improved over the past year, so I thought I'd re-evaluate it. Many of the issues I had with the older version have been fixed, so I increased my rating to 4-stars. However, it still doesn't meet my needs in that it doesn't work offline. As a nature photographer, I am away from an internet connection frequently and this app requires a connection to function. 
org.wordpress.android#100681:	  Love a lot...yet I am not satisfied with the designs and there are few crash issues 
org.wordpress.android#100682:	  My posts are not getting uploaded in it 
org.wordpress.android#100688:	   I was wondering why wordpress is so not comfortable now? I have some problems when I will post something in my wordpress. When I will add an image of my post, there are something problem. The application say that an error, but my connection is ok. I hope you can fix it. Thankyou. 
org.wordpress.android#100695:	   Sometimes it just cannot upload picture to new post. I tried many times. Its stuck at 90% uploaded. Freeze there. I really need this apps. Easy for me to update my post via mobile. Please fix it.

org.wordpress.android#100750:	   Actually good app but so many mistakes. Hope to get an update soon. Can't publish like it is now. Static front page plus blog doesn't work. Edit page..add text and posts in it doesnt work. Updates shown after days! 
org.wordpress.android#100752:	  I'd really love if my blog would open in-app and give an option if I want it open in web view. Also, it would be wonderful if posts didn't appear out of order. It's better if algorithms weren't used. 
org.wordpress.android#100768:	   The app is running good for beginners like me.. but after update , we unable to post image and also..cant able to publish the blog..from app.. very sucking update plz do anything but plz remove this bug asap 
org.wordpress.android#100771:	   Previous version (on my Android phone) wouldn't let me access my Notifications, so I just updated the app, hoping this would help. Now it won't even let me in to my own site unless I click on View External - but then I no longer have access to any options like Stats, edit, etc. Not user friendly, and very frustrating. Please fix these problems! UPDATE: After a "response" and multiple uninstalls, reinstalls & updates, same problem is still there. Can't access my own blog using this app! Useless. 
org.wordpress.android#100780:	   Never lags, never stopped working, never force close, this is an app with sleek GUI and smooth connection through all feeds, it is awsome 
org.wordpress.android#100787:	   Extremely poor performance. No peer certificate error over and over again 
org.wordpress.android#100806:	   So buggy. Rarely loads posts, fails to update posts, throws errors loading post categories, image uploads usually fail. It's clunky to use, the UI seems to be from 1997. Only has about a third of desktop features. I'd gladly pay if someone built this app properly, but this thing's a train wreck. 
org.wordpress.android#100813:	   It's been two time since i had to register with same password and both the the times i was able to register.. got confirmation of registration .. but when i try to open it again with same link ot says"email not valid".. then i had to download this app but the problem still persists...

org.wordpress.android#100891:	   Works well but can't upload multiple photos. When I try it seems to merge 2 or 3 files into the same jpeg. Please fix. 
org.wordpress.android#100893:	   I previously had an issue with inserting images and was asked to contact the support team. However, the problem seems to have fixed itself, so I'm guessing it was an awful internet connection causing it, not the app itself.

org.wordpress.android#100911:	   Read more button. I can't find and use read more button, definitely I need it. Could you mind to add read more button? It will be more helpful. Thank you. 
org.wordpress.android#100912:	   Text or Image, nothing can be uploaded with this version. I will change my rating once it is fixed. 
org.wordpress.android#100922:	   I don't know what happened, but as of this morning, my wordpress app is no longer working correctly. Words are getting jumbled up while writing a blog and you are constantly having to go back to fix all the grammar errors thanks to the new update...or whatever they did. Awful!!! 
org.wordpress.android#100931:	   Stats won't refresh, connection error messages, won't load media... Uninstalled and downloaded 3 times, but no change! So disappointed! I could do with a WP app while on the move!!!! 
org.wordpress.android#100932:	  Can't login 
org.wordpress.android#100935:	   the app is amazing. using it for months. but in the previous version(5.9) the color of the 'cursor' was white, what created much more problems during copying or pasting. now it's replaced with gray one.  for this. 
org.wordpress.android#100942:	   'Posts couldn't be refreshed at this time'. No error message, no indication of what the problem is. Uninstalled. 
org.wordpress.android#100947:	   Crashes a lot on Android 7.0 
org.wordpress.android#100948:	   The app was very useful until updated . Can't find drafts and also can not edit draft. Now the new feed is just in the mess. Instead of showing the lastest post from blogs that I follow like it used to, now it wasn't sorted by time and make it hard to find new posts. 
org.wordpress.android#100952:	   I try to post something,but it doesn't work... it always shows Post Update error 
org.wordpress.android#100966:	  It does not let me post my articles. Every time I click post, it says that an error has occured. Hope u'll take notice 
org.wordpress.android#100974:	   I've made security with my phone number. It always ask me to input verification code, BUT when I click resend SMS code, never arrived any message on my android. Please fix it.. My phone number is right! Thanks in advance, I always write my stories or my articles on wordpress, so I won't to delete this app on my android 
org.wordpress.android#100991:	   Any notification is not show this app when any one is comment and likes in my website. Please solve this problem or more improve in next version. 
org.wordpress.android#100996:	   After logging in, the blog posts from my website fails to connect. My posts don't show on the website because it cannot connect 
org.wordpress.android#101000:	   I used to like it, but now after new update on my Android phone, everytime I want to check my stats, posts, etc it complains that my log in and password are incorrect . Even if I reset my password on a Web version it still complains about my credentials which is very annoying.Could you please fix this issue because at this moment is useless I affraid. Interestingly, iOS version works fine. 
org.wordpress.android#101003:	  The app is amazing as ever but I have two issues. One is getting the same notification multiple times in succession. The other is that the last two updates have removed the word count from the posts in my reader. Would love to have that back. Also, if you guys could add a word count marker in the post-writing section, it'd be terrific. As it stands, there's no idea how long my posts have gone. Thanks. 
org.wordpress.android#101009:	   cannot edit title of post. i will lg vu2, android 4.1, in offline mode. please help to fix it. 
org.wordpress.android#101014:	   I can't login to my account :( 
org.wordpress.android#101024:	   (new review, previously one star) Works great, interface seems a little crowded, but gets the job done and is a better experience than the mobile site. Can't get this to run very well if at all when on my SD card, not sure if that is on the app or my phone. (Reason for one star review, before moving it to internal storage) 
org.wordpress.android#101040:	   It is very useless app. I have entered all correct log in details but even though it fails. Very poor app. 
org.wordpress.android#101066:	   The app was great in my old fone but when i installed it in the new device (redmi3sprime), i stopped getting notified from wordpress when somebody likes or replies to my comments. I have checked with the notification settings n app settings n they are ON. I checked with the settings on my fone too. Yet im not getting any notifications. What do i do? . 
org.wordpress.android#101075:	   What is the problem with media upload? Its been happening for weeks now both on the web and on the app. 
org.wordpress.android#101083:	   On an older version I couldn't get the app to load at all. Since updating, the app is getting better. Now the main issue is sometimes it fails to connect to the internet, forcing me to use the browser instead of the app. 
org.wordpress.android#101087:	   I can't find the stats widget anymore. This was the only reason I used the app. I run a photography website but I'm not able to edit portfolios with the app which, makes it entirely useless for me now. 
org.wordpress.android#101100:	  Ohh plz fix the error i cant published my post after a latest update 
org.wordpress.android#101104:	   Still need an update. Previous update didnt fix the issue about image uploading. 
org.wordpress.android#101109:	   Always gets 505 error when installing 
org.wordpress.android#101126:	   Nice app, but wish you can fix the non availability of undo button in case there is an error 
org.wordpress.android#101130:	  Can't login... its showing wrong password and email. 
org.wordpress.android#101133:	   Would you like to trust the certificate anyway? I press yes but not working please fix this issue 
org.wordpress.android#101138:	  Issue has been solved. Thanks a lott. 
org.wordpress.android#101142:	   Works great, I haven't had any issues with crashes or things not operating properly. It works better than the website sometimes! 
org.wordpress.android#101155:	   At the browser,we can insert documents.but by this app, only option is to insert video and image and not any other thing. Please solve this issue so can anyone insert documents or compressed zip folders easily. Please...... 
org.wordpress.android#101156:	   Reader layout changes aside, which are annoying, the reader itself is auto refreshing now, but it's also not showing posts like it should. I'm seeing blog I follow not showing in my followed sites list, but showing by tag. Please keep working to fix this. 
org.wordpress.android#101164:	   Why always error to uploading a picture? 
org.wordpress.android#101166:	  My Post Never Publishes, Please Fix it Everytime i try To Publish My Post It Says " An Error Occured While Publsishing This Post" Fix It And Ill Give 5 Starts 
org.wordpress.android#101184:	   Now unable to add new posts via the app. Can't even log in to a self hosted site again if you log out. Keep getting error messages. Makes the app useless. 
org.wordpress.android#101189:	   Does not allow you to login to a self-hosted site. Worse, the forum moderators are not interested in solving this problem. They merely cut off any comments about this problem. Work around: delete the app. Access WordPress with a browser. 
org.wordpress.android#101204:	   I made a page for a game I play and I love how easy and mostly intuitive it is to use. Its so easy to manage and update content and I like being able to see comments posted without having to actually go to my page. The only down side I have run into is iOS users seem to have difficulties viewing the page and that can be a problem for me as many people in the aforementioned game are iOS users 
org.wordpress.android#101209:	   Just blogged photos of all the new fabric i bought with sizes and it crashed and lost all measurements. I also wish it wouldn't just save local draft as I had an issue with phone version and couldn't edit on laptop till I published it. Frustrated. 
org.wordpress.android#101210:	   Even if I know my user name and password i cannot login 
org.wordpress.android#101223:	   I have been getting some hard time uploading the pictures. It just get stuck in the very end. Pls fix this. Used to be nice app... 
org.wordpress.android#101224:	  It doesn't save my draft when I switch to another app, my writing suddenly disappear. 
org.wordpress.android#101226:	   This is nice app but when we use in android "insert read more tag" not seen. Plz solve this issue. 
org.wordpress.android#101244:	   Used to be a good app. But it sucks big time now. I can't upload images. It always gives and error. I'm going to uninstall this app. This would have been very useful for creating a blog while being mobile. 
org.wordpress.android#101246:	  Update: Taking the suggestion from dev to use the support, got response: the help support close until September 22nd (today is the 12th) .... Check the error myself, maybe the xmlrpc.php? install the suggested 5 year old plugin, rename the file, still cant, check forum? a lot of the same problem but no answer. This is fresh installed wp ---------- I never had success with this app for self hosted WordPress, two main problem, to login & to upload pictures, always this problem, i tried this app last year, now, the same problem still appear 
org.wordpress.android#101247:	   Why I can't access to my account? I can do it in my laptop. 
org.wordpress.android#101263:	   Went to create a blog post today using my WordPress app and discovered that the editor is some weird, useless version of what it was before. I can't do anything in it like I can in the web based editor such as indent, center, size/place images, etc....literally every major function but basic typing is gone. Where did it go and how do I get it back? If this is not fixed I am uninstalling the app as it is totally useless to me without the full version of the editor. As well, the web based editor crashes EVERY SINGLE TIME I do an update to a blog. Makes editing virtually impossible. - - - I received an automated response to this review which said, "You can switch back to the app's old editor: Go to App Settings in the app and toggle off the 'Show Visual Editor' option. However, some of the features you mentioned (such as indenting or aligning text) weren't part of the old editor, either." - - - Found the setting. That leaves ONLY the HTML editor and does not fix the problem...at all. And, previously, before this change, the editor in my app and the web based editor were identical in their features. 
org.wordpress.android#101268:	   Some features were not working on my android. 
org.wordpress.android#101275:	  There is a problem not being able to make a text "sticky"!!!!!! 
org.wordpress.android#101283:	   Every rime I try and edit a post or post an original with photos the app just keeps crashing. This is SO frustrating! !!!! Please fix it!! 
org.wordpress.android#101284:	   I used to run my site from the mobile device, worked smooth and fast. A few weeks ago the app stopped uploading images to the site and now I can no longer look at the stats from the site. Hopefully this is updated soon. 
org.wordpress.android#101285:	   sahi hey but thora bug hey 
org.wordpress.android#101290:	  All good but facing some problem with stats 
org.wordpress.android#101297:	  Really not happy. Just typed out a post and scheduled it. It's now vanished and I can't get it back. Also, Instead of giving us useless features, why not allow us to have multiple accounts set up? It's the one feature majority of users need. With apps like wordpress being used for business as well as personal blogs, surely this feature should be essential? 
org.wordpress.android#101301:	   Not get plugin in this app 
org.wordpress.android#101303:	   Won't let me sign into WordPress self hosted accounts anymore. No matter how many times I try. So I have no use for the app unless the issue is solved 
org.wordpress.android#101311:	   I find this useless for me as there is no option for seo of your post. How do i publish my post without doing seo of it. Solve this problem of app. 
org.wordpress.android#101327:	   Needs more work. The app also fails to load all followed posts. Unless you open it every few hours you can look forward to missing some of the posts that you would have liked to have seen. I loaded my Reader in the app, and compared it with the browser version. In 12 hours I lost 50 posts. So. Useless if you only check once daily. Also needs better text formatting control. 
org.wordpress.android#101328:	   Hasn't really failed me. Performs very well. I like it a lot. 
org.wordpress.android#101330:	   I'm using Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. Ever since I downloaded this application, I cant log in, it said something went wrong, and I didnt know why. When I checked the log, it contained soo many codes which I didnt understand. Please fix it. I really need this because I'm a blogger. 
org.wordpress.android#101333:	   Yes, I'm using it and it work better than blogger app. But i don't get earning option from here 
org.wordpress.android#101339:	   I am not sure what happened. On Thursday, this app was amazing. I used it to do work when I was on the road, updating different things on the dashboard from my app. No joke, I loved this app. I manage 5 sites through it. I went to Canada and came back to the states this morning, and now I have to go through the Internet to access the dashboard which means I have to log in every time too. Ugh. This is terrible for someone like me who does web page admin on the go. Big fail, wordpress. 
org.wordpress.android#101344:	   I did write a review about the app crashing and looking my drafts the other week. I've got a new, updated phone and got the app. There's some problems that are still in the app as in my old phone. When wanting to add a picture from my phone gallery, most pictures don't show up and they aren't in order so it's hard to find the ones I want. Sometimes, when I click somewhere on a line or in a paragraph to type it selects the very beginning of the post or the very end and not where I click. Thanks 
org.wordpress.android#101361:	   when i post something it fails. it is not even showing me my current posts which I have posted from computer. no peer certificate error and by 3g it was uploaded. 
org.wordpress.android#101387:	   This app is good only for viewing daily stats. Other wise its useless , it can't upload pics , and after writing whole blog it says sorry blog can't be uploaded!!!!! Please fix these errors otherwise I have to delete this app!!! 
org.wordpress.android#101388:	   I was previously able to view my blog in app on my android but for the last week I can't. Pointless having app if can only see the blog in external browser, as it's too small. Don't know why it's changed but have uninstalled as no use to me now. Will have to update via desktop. Disappointed that WP can't fix this. I contacted numerous times and got no response. 
org.wordpress.android#101392:	   I have so much trouble getting the spacing I want between sentences and paragraphs. Also, sometimes I copy and paste and it's nearly impossible to get the fonts right. There is no built in font list. Please fix! 
org.wordpress.android#101397:	   I have two blogs and I can't seem to log in both of them. This was not a problem in the earliest version that I used. Now it seems that the option to add another blog is only for a self hosted domain. I've got 2 (dot) WordPress (dot) com blogs. How should I log in them both??? 
org.wordpress.android#101400:	  constant errors signing into self-hosted site 
org.wordpress.android#101402:	   I have a little problem few days ago I uploaded 60 /70 photos at same time select all and uploading start now little problem I want too upload 50 photos same time every picture show try again plzzzz help me 
org.wordpress.android#101405:	   Lost me three day's worth of work! Finally published my article from draft tonight but it didn't show up. Now I can no longer find it! Fix this or see yourself lose a loyal customer! Update: now reliable. Now actually a wordpress app indeed! 
org.wordpress.android#101414:	   COULDN'T LOGIN IN 
org.wordpress.android#101426:	   Yes, what i need from this app just simple add wordpress site and manage site from the admin panel,but now after "View Admin" features not in app anymore , i mean redirect to external browser, for me..it's not usefull...because i need to enter my credentials for that site again, anyway..still a good apps..if possible please make it available again... 
org.wordpress.android#101429:	   When I change my phone to Oppo F1 Plus, I did not receive any verification code by sms (if I login with apps) . If I login from website, Everything is okay. And then, I turn off the two-step authentication (I thought I can login via apps if I turn it off) but the result is the same, I can't login. Maybe because the apps doesnt support in android version 5.1? 
org.wordpress.android#101430:	  Works good, but there are some - understandable - problems with compatibility with third party plugins. 
org.wordpress.android#101442:	   I like my text to be aligned as justify and there are no text alignment options I can see. I can't publish posts from my phone without having to go on desktop and justify text first. It's a pain. As is uploading images to a post. But for rough drafts, this thing has changed the way I blog. Please fix missing features or just direct me to them if I've missed them! Thanks! **EDIT** Thank you for responding. Of course! I should have thought of that. It's not as easy as the kitchen sink but it'll do! 
org.wordpress.android#101444:	   i had this rated 5 stars, but the app changed and now i can't find the "more" tag. It really reduces my happiness with the app. Maybe i'll have to move to Blogger. 
org.wordpress.android#101445:	   I normally use my phone to write blogs and then suddenly after this update, I'm not able to do a single thing properly. It's so disgusting. The pictures won't upload and then suddenly after writing a whole post,the article disappeared. Moreover,after I uploaded my article, I wanted to edit it but then it won't show up in the blog post section. Do something about it. It's getting difficult to write. 
org.wordpress.android#101457:	   This app gives me an error message everytime I try to publish my post. Please fix it. 
org.wordpress.android#101459:	   I use this on my phone all the time to work on my blog. On the whole it's excellent however one thing I find really annoying is how the align function for inserting media spells center wrong for HTML. I know centre is correct but the browser doesn't know that! This is an easy fix for next update, please 
org.wordpress.android#101467:	   This app is not very good. It worked on one of my devices for a little while. But it doesn't let you login to external sites very easily. Even though I'm typing in the correct password and username and url I can still not login on the app but I can online. Needs fixed. 
org.wordpress.android#101484:	   I cannot log in to my account to customize my theme. I've changed my password 3 times because i thought it's my mistake. But no. Can log in on pc without problems. Only problem is with da app. 
org.wordpress.android#101491:	   I used this on my phone as I preferred word press over tumblr but the mobile client isn't as responsive. It would get stuck on uploading pictures frequently despite me working on Wi-Fi instead of data. I have high speed internet and tested other sites to determine whether it was me or the app... It was the app. Great when it does work, just has issues with pictures and gifs. 
org.wordpress.android#101492:	   Everytime I have to comment or like a post I have to log in and again and it redirects me to the browser version. Please fix this its really annoying 
org.wordpress.android#101496:	  When I m clicking on view admin it directly redirect to chrome,,,,, not opening with in app;;;;; please suggest how to fix it 
org.wordpress.android#101500:	   Kindly fix the issue of image uploading 
org.wordpress.android#101508:	   Wtf ? Why can't ? Is that a problem with app? 
org.wordpress.android#101509:	   This app is useless for anything other than to check the traffic to the site. I have been trying to upload a photo post for 3 days. It just stalls the upload at 20%. Also what bullshit about custom notifications, the WP app for blackberry curve had that feature back in 2012. Don't make excuses about the OS browser's compatibility and get to work fixing the issues. 
org.wordpress.android#101510:	   Since I updated last week I don't get notifications on who liked or commented on my blog and its really affecting me pls fix this problem pls 
org.wordpress.android#101518:	   Can't upload image or gif from the motorola x play or samsung s4 to the app. So it's like word press viewer 2.0. Need to fix that. 
org.wordpress.android#101523:	   , and 3 times everything is deleted... Like its disapere from memory, i pissing!!!!! Pls fix this bug... 
org.wordpress.android#101524:	   Didn't work first with self-hosted sites, but apparently Ubuntu xenial doesn't install php-xml by default while Trusty did (default LAMP install). To bad it doesn't do single sign on when you go to view the admin settings for example (starts webbrowser) 
org.wordpress.android#101531:	  Not working anymore :( 
org.wordpress.android#101532:	  This app crashes on my phone and it doesn't accept my credentials when I try to sign on 
org.wordpress.android#101537:	   For completely complicating my otherwise simple life and keeping me irritated at all times. I have started hating this name "WordPress". I just want to delete my account on it but i can't login even after using my login credentials. 
org.wordpress.android#101539:	   This version failed to upload photos and publish edited post which i edited on my phone. 
org.wordpress.android#101540:	  Not working 
org.wordpress.android#101544:	   Some problem in themes selection and editing 
org.wordpress.android#101552:	   Whenever I add photo on phone app, it will not work. It always stopped after I chose photo. Why? 
org.wordpress.android#101553:	   It was running fine, all these years. Now I am unable to use it because it says "Can't upload the post, no peer certificate! !" Such a disappointment! ! Any suggestions? ! 
org.wordpress.android#101555:	   Overall a clean, easy to use app. Pretty simple features compared to the desktop site. However, it's pretty unfortunate and cumbersome that drafts don't sync between the app and the desktop version. 
org.wordpress.android#101556:	   The app is really good at what it does but it has some problems with uploading photos some times in the posts, the uploads would just freeze and is missing a search function for categories and a tags picked like on the web version. Other than that is really good to go and useful!! 
org.wordpress.android#101559:	   I mentioned the reader I meant I'm not able to view my site in-app. I like using this app even when there's issues but I'd love it if the reader returns. I do like the addition of searching for posts via keywords & hope that stays. An improvement would be if the posts related to the keyword(s) weren't in random order by date. Also, I've noticed when I try to visit self-hosted sites it goes to their blog in-app it'd be nice if they were available to view in reader. 
org.wordpress.android#101565:	  Works great! If you are having problems, triple check that your plugins aren't blocking something the mobile app is trying to communicate with. 
org.wordpress.android#101569:	   Previous version was more handy. Cut/copy/past and editing problems in new version. Now I am working with HTML tab without any problems. 
org.wordpress.android#101570:	   i tried to add new blog on the app and it did not give me the chance to. please fix it. there is also the problem of writing from left to right. As arabic needs to be from right to left. 
org.wordpress.android#101580:	   Well the new update has solved the problem, the action button replaced with publish button in write post works and options are shown in are better. Its all thanx to the concern and effort of the developers team trying to fix the problem. 
org.wordpress.android#101590:	   App lacks a lot of basics when trying to write a post (font alignment options and such) which is annoying. Push notifications have stopped working, even though I have them enabled in the settings. The app does not sync with anything done on another device (whether a pc or another mobile device) so I can't draft a post on my phone then do final editing and uploading on the computer or vice versea etc. So many little issues add up to an app that is a hassle to use rather than the convenience it should be. 
org.wordpress.android#101593:	   The latest update removed the View Site option within the app and now opens up in an external application. Please fix this. 
org.wordpress.android#101595:	  The whole app is ok but my biggest issue is how to sign out from the app and remain signed out. Any suggestions or help? 
org.wordpress.android#101599:	   I use this app all the time. After the last update I can't view my blog anymore. Frustrating, I hope you fix it really soon. 
org.wordpress.android#101602:	  Update in webpage required...errors 
org.wordpress.android#101615:	   It keeps crashing after the last update!! 
org.wordpress.android#101617:	   It's very easy to use but "link are disabled on preview screen" that's problem come to me after latest update. Editing post in preview screen shows all editing feature like color font, under line font, justify paragraph etc. So that's why plz enable this editing link in post preview screen. 
org.wordpress.android#101619:	   In the latest update the choice for "View my site" has been removed. I assume that this is an error, but I would rather have it back since it allows users to inspect our blogs in real time, which is a very useful blogging feature. 
org.wordpress.android#101623:	   I still have problems with the UI on this new version not "keeping up". Deleting text results in the cursor missing words, going "through" them and then deleting the word before instead. 
org.wordpress.android#101634:	   I was putting up a draft and when I saved it it disappeared and I can't get back to edit it. Where did it go? That's a very useless option. 
org.wordpress.android#101638:	   I'm traveling and using this app to big my experiences and share photos. I'm so disappointed in cannot upload photos. When I click, Add New, nothing happens. Please fix!! 
org.wordpress.android#101641:	   I can't Upload pic on My Post 
org.wordpress.android#101642:	   I loved how easily I could upload images for my posts on wordpress. But with the app, I cannot upload an image, even if I tapped on the "Add new" tab. Also, I have to sign in everytime I want to access to my account, in spite of checking the "Keep me signed in" box. I can't find an alternative app for WordPress and I am really disappointed with the app of the website I so love. 
org.wordpress.android#101653:	   Why is the break feature in previous version missing.... Plz fix and fast cos I really need it in my blog!!!! 
org.wordpress.android#101661:	  Not uploading images 
org.wordpress.android#101664:	   impossible to write with; could not upload photos 
org.wordpress.android#101665:	  Thought this was a simple way to easily create a blog but it wouldn't let me have the same username/blog/url name so I attempted to delete but apparently that isn't an option. Followed all the steps to change my email, that won't work either. I've tried several times and the link I'm being sent via email just keeps bringing up a page telling me I need to confirm my email again. I clicked contact us to get help, but it just posts it to a community forum???? I just want the whole blog/username GONE 
org.wordpress.android#101670:	    but music media not upload plz add this future for free 
org.wordpress.android#101674:	   Uploads fail with or without images, without reason. Other reviews seem to indicate it's a crap-shoot; sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. These days, it's just as easy to use the WordPress Web Interface. Easier. Don't waste your time on an app that fails so frequently. 
org.wordpress.android#101675:	   Still trying to get to grips with it on mobile devices, very slow going, need to find a guide. IS WHAT I SAID THEN.... The next day I was contacted and given the exact guide I needed! It doesn't get better than this! Thanks Wordpress! 
org.wordpress.android#101678:	   I am unable to upload my media on wordpress.. please fix it asap. Its wasting my time now. I've been trying it from last week . 
org.wordpress.android#101682:	   Useless. Please fix it. I cannot log in to update my site. The new version is no longer compatible with Android. I am on LG G3 and cannot log in. Log in works fine from PC. 
org.wordpress.android#101685:	   I used to love how convenient it was to make posts on the go but recently my app has been malfunctioning. It won't save any of the updates I made on my computer and it continuously exits me out the app! Ugh it's so annoying! But having it is really useful when it's working properly. 
org.wordpress.android#101702:	  After an update I am not able to upload any of my new post. Please do check out the issue with this. 
org.wordpress.android#101703:	  why my wordpress blog cannot open? when i was customize my wp at the web..its totally fine...but now i only can publish my story but cannot open the web 
org.wordpress.android#101704:	   I write longer and more often now with this app. It's excellent and only limited by the quality of your mobile typing. The new Visual Editor doesn't work. Typing places text in random positions on the page and removes other parts of your post uncontrollably. Only the html editor is usable. 
org.wordpress.android#101706:	  I cannot even see what to write. Half of my page is hidden by another half. How do I fix this????? 
org.wordpress.android#101709:	   Why its saying that an error uccured when i am creating new account..nd also its not telling whats the error..plz respond me fast nd plz fix this 
org.wordpress.android#101711:	   This application is not allowing me to upload pictures and some of my posting don't get uploaded. The application also shuts down erasing your work. I will use my internet browser then this application. 
org.wordpress.android#101717:	   Ever since this new update I cannot upload any pics to my new posts. I try via WiFi and with my use of 4G but still nothing. I'm using a samsung galaxy s7. I choose a pic but never finishes to upload. Can I get some help please. 
org.wordpress.android#101722:	   I can no longer choose to write my texts as a heading format, which is frustrating. Please fix this asap ty 
org.wordpress.android#101728:	   When i try to attach pictures the app freezes and say wordpress stopped working. Otherwise i love the app 
org.wordpress.android#101730:	  I like this app. The only thing I have a problem with is changing my email. I made the mistake of using my business email instead of my writing, but instead of changing it, i made a whole other blog account lol Oops 
org.wordpress.android#101731:	   Videos won't upload, the keyboard glitches. The mobile app sucks, the follow blog widget isn't working. It keeps sending my users to have to log in when they try to like or follow my blog. And I have tried to fix this over and over and over. It shouldn't be so hard to allow people to like the blog! 
org.wordpress.android#101733:	   Before I could hit publish and it would do the entire post. Now it seems like I have to do every image individually and with 20 images or so this is tedious, plus they stop uploading and it takes ten tries to finally get them uploaded (I'm doing full size. Also, I like the idea of being able to insert many images at once, but without the ability to sort them by folder, this feature is pretty useless if you have hundreds and hundreds of images on your phone because it's impossible to find the right ones. 
org.wordpress.android#101736:	   In app I can't upload any files. 
org.wordpress.android#101738:	   Earlier I wrote that it was not working but now it has started working and it is working good. Except one thing that it does not give an option of h2 or h3 tags. 
org.wordpress.android#101744:	   Everytime I try to upload a photo it crashes 
org.wordpress.android#101749:	  Can't upload any photo or other documents with h defeats the point of me using the app version 
org.wordpress.android#101755:	   I wish the bug I have had ever since I first downloaded a WordPress App would be fixed. When deleting a letter on tags it will wither delete two letters of get rid of all spaces. Been there for years. Otherwise great app. 
org.wordpress.android#101765:	   When writing a post on the desktop and mobile sites, and on the windows app it allows you to control where your posts are being sent. For example to twitter, Facebook etc. But the app doesn't. I don't necessarily want to send all my posts to social media so why isn't this control in place? 2 stars until this is fixed. 
org.wordpress.android#101767:	   I love the app and use it all the time to tell about my family's travels. Latest update broke the ability to write in Hebrew, all the text is left-to-right. Pressing HTML fixes that temporarily, but I can't use the rich text option with Hebrew. Please please fix this! 
org.wordpress.android#101773:	  I use this App very often. It's very useful but there are A few issues that I encounter .... the Like button on a post never works for me. There's no problem 'liking' a comment or even posting a comment but the like button on a post is a big issue. How do I rectify it? 
org.wordpress.android#101777:	  Whenever I publish using my phone app, it fails to post and an error occurs. Please fix this so that it becomes easy to update through my phone and I don't have to open it on my desktop everytime I want to publish. 
org.wordpress.android#101782:	   Used to be good until last update. Now it is slow and pictures don't upload. Disappointed to say the least. 
org.wordpress.android#101787:	   "This post has local changes that have not been published". This message continues to appear no matter what I do and I cannot get it to download the latest version of the post from the server which is edits ahead. 
org.wordpress.android#101789:	   I have been using WordPress for coming on 4 years now and it's come a long way. There are not many problems for me now that I've figured out the specifics. But there is break in time. 
org.wordpress.android#101796:	  I like the addition of putting a link in now! But you also took away adding a read more thing. Unless I just can't find it, the button for it isn't there anymore. 
org.wordpress.android#101801:	   Been using this phone app for months because i find it easier to prepare and upload blog entries on the go. But for some reason, after the update i keep on LOSING EVERYTHING I HAVE WRITTEN. I HATE IT SO MUCH NOW and i hope you fix this. I haven't posted any blog entry for a couple of days now becausr that keeps on happening! 
org.wordpress.android#101805:	    since I updated to 5.5. please fix this and get 5star from me. Apart from this, the app is great 
org.wordpress.android#101810:	   I've been using this app for some time for short private posts as a starting point for posts I'll finish up on a laptop. I've always had good results and for normal use I cannot fault it. I have however recently added U2F support via a Yubico recommended plugin for use with my Yubikey NEO. I now find I cannot login via this app. 
org.wordpress.android#101826:	   This app makes blogging so much easier.But now my 'Action' button to be able to save isn't working.Any help would be appreciated. 
org.wordpress.android#101827:	   I have been trying to upload images for quite some time and the media simply will not upload. I Uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Made sure my themes and plug-ins on my self hosted WordPress blog were all updated . Checked the dimensions of the image. There is a progress bar when the image is being uploaded and no matter how many times I try or how long I wait...the image doesn't get uploaded and there is always an error. 
org.wordpress.android#101828:	   Where i can find the "read more" function? I can't find it when i updated the app.. 
org.wordpress.android#101836:	  Won't upload pics easily or let me make edits. 
org.wordpress.android#101837:	   Can you please fix or explain why the new post editor strips all the captions I have written for images? Update 2/7: contacted support team, no response. Your editor is stripping HTML that was previously fine and does not even display captions anymore. Posting images is also extremely clunky and I am not sure how to get multiple images to appear side by side anymore. The new version is a regression. Guess I will look for a new blog platform 
org.wordpress.android#101841:	   I have this app on my Samsung tablet, and it has been repeatedly DELETING MY ENTIRE POSTS AS I WRITE THEM. This is EXTREMELY frustrating, as I am overseas and don't have time to rewrite my posts. FIX THIS. 
org.wordpress.android#101845:	   Warning! Don't use this app to write your posts. Safer to write them elsewhere and then copy paste and upload, which essentially you could do using just the website so it renders the app pretty useless. I have lost hours of work on a blog post, all my text from the post disappeared (not sure what I pressed) then I pressed the back button on my tablet and the app saved my new (blank) post. No option to restore a previous version as all my work was done offline as local draft. Not safe to work on this alone! 
org.wordpress.android#101846:	   Please, I can't find the page break function in this new update.... How do I insert page break... Please, I need an urgent reply!!! 
org.wordpress.android#101851:	   . Have to add image to media library first before inserting to post. Please fix it 
org.wordpress.android#101856:	   I can't login to my self hosted site, please fix it! 
org.wordpress.android#101860:	   Plz enable the to upload plugins from mobile it's not working...otherwise 5 stars.. 
org.wordpress.android#101862:	   Sticky and crashes a lot now. FFS. 
org.wordpress.android#101865:	  Since the update some of my words are typed twice when I press the space bar on my keyboard. It seems to happen at random but only happens in the WordPress app and only since the update. This is very irritating as I cannot get through a sentence without having to edit my typing. Also, it'd be great if posts didn't automatically try to refresh and only show the most recent few when I open the app as it makes it a pain to go back to older posts as I have to re-download them taking too much time and using too much data. 
org.wordpress.android#101867:	   Sometimes won't save my drafts. :( 
org.wordpress.android#101872:	   The latest version won't let me upload any pic, it just failed & crash all the time :( 
org.wordpress.android#101875:	   PLZ FIX! 
org.wordpress.android#101876:	  Don't know why but I cannot upload photos to my blog. Otherwise five stars. 
org.wordpress.android#101879:	   Page edits didn't sync to the server then when I opened the dash board they reverted to pre edit versions. Can't trust the app. 
org.wordpress.android#101883:	   From recent updates facing a problem. While uploading it shows "error occured uploading media" even stable data network . Please fix the bug... 
org.wordpress.android#101885:	   Bad aap don't use tis aap use weebly 
org.wordpress.android#101887:	   Not opening in my android mobile and my windows 10 laptop.. any solutions to this? 
org.wordpress.android#101889:	   Please solve issues in setting pictures 
org.wordpress.android#101891:	   I've tried many times to upload a photo but it always says that theres an error! Other than that, the app is really good and I enjoy using it :) 
org.wordpress.android#101899:	   Is not working if a http protection is in place. Can login and see the content but can not update it 
org.wordpress.android#101909:	   I have never been able to login using this app. Are you having problems with self hosted? Does it effect the app if the blog is on a sub domain? 
org.wordpress.android#101927:	   Early versions had severe bugs making it semi-unusable. Now it can get the job done, but there are still plenty of little rough spots. 
org.wordpress.android#101929:	   Do not download this app.. stcik to PC. You just can never upload a single pic or video. This is pathetic. Worth -5* 
org.wordpress.android#101931:	  Upload keeps failing 
org.wordpress.android#101932:	   Com'on guys. Just because the Internet died for a few moments at some point, I lost my entire post. Wouldn't you want to save a copy on my device (or on my website in drafts) once in a while just in case? Uninstalling and using browser from now on. Epic fail. 
org.wordpress.android#101937:	   Can't upload media from my galary ever after trying several times. Very disappointed wordpress. 
org.wordpress.android#101947:	   App works great, some navigation issues at first but pretty smooth overall. 
org.wordpress.android#101954:	   Does not work for self hosted 
org.wordpress.android#101959:	   Wordpress is my free app to post my personal blog. For seven years I have been blogging on Wordpress with no complaints. The only drawback is that occasionally the folks over at Wordpress change something that is not broken in the software; consequently; the fix creates a glitch in the app that takes a while for WordPress to correct. 
org.wordpress.android#101960:	   I can't login to my self hosted site, even though it is online. I can get to it through a browser but not the app. I would really like this to work, but I have no idea why it isn't. Website is techscout.online if you want to check if it is online. 
org.wordpress.android#101968:	   I have a website hosted through WordPress and I am unable to actually post anything. I can get into my account and set up a post, but it will not publish. Even if its just text. What's the problem??? 
org.wordpress.android#101969:	   It's cool and awesome. But break (read more) function is missing. I can't find it on the mobile. Bring it back 
org.wordpress.android#101972:	   I'll give 5 stars only if i can upload multiple images from the app. Even on mobile view i had to upload 1 image at time which is time consuming... fix please... 
org.wordpress.android#101984:	   I was using the previous version of worpress and after the update j cant add my webiste which is hosted externally.. please help. This app was really helpful for me. But not it stopped working. 
org.wordpress.android#101993:	  Can't upload documents 
org.wordpress.android#102000:	   Please try to fix the glitches that come with trying to upload media- it makes posting on a device a pain 
org.wordpress.android#102002:	   Don't use the app much. I forgot my username, password, etc. They require too much information from to login. Never saw or given the opportunity to go "Contact Us". 
org.wordpress.android#102003:	   I'm not sure what the bug is, or if it is a "feature" but I have been working on a document for some time that I was nowhere near ready to publish... Thinking that "draft" and saving means that, you know, it is going to save your post as a draft, shouldn't raise any questions. Unfortunately, as pretty as the app is, every time I close my tablet or disconnect from wifi for a moment, every supposedly "saved" draft immediately deletes itself forever leaving only the post title behind. Why. Why??? 
org.wordpress.android#102012:	   I love wordpress on the desktop. On my pc I can access my site easily. But the app refuses to allow me to sign in. It tells me my login information is wrong, yet I can sign in just fine on my other PCs. Not sure what the issue is with the app, but I am forced to use my mobile browsers to use Wordpress on my phone, which is a shame. I will change my rating if I can find a solution to the problem. 
org.wordpress.android#102019:	   My app decided to fail on me during uploading, no big deal right? I tap the notice and my post comes up empty! My content was all erased except for the title! Wtf!!! This should NEVER happen!!! 
org.wordpress.android#102024:	   After latest update, can't even open app now. It crashes everytime i try opening app 
org.wordpress.android#102036:	   Though I don't use wordpress mobile for penning new blogs, it is great way to read blogs and keep a check on the updates in my blogs. I have to say that the application has improved over the time and I can hardly find any fault with the app. 
org.wordpress.android#102039:	   I've repeatedly clicked on the "select image" button, but still, no dialogs or whatsoever appears, I need to enhance my site, but I can't upload a single picture to change my header, Id love to suggest u to fix this asap, anyw good app! I love it! I love how it is minimalist! No regrets!! 
org.wordpress.android#102044:	   I used to give the app 5 stars, but they changed something with an update and I lost selfhosted access through this app. If WordPress would simply start making YouTube video tutorials for setting up these type of apps and server prerequisites, support would be much simpler. Dozens of people having the same problem, asking for help in the WordPress forums, and being treated like trash. WordPress support system (along with this app) sucks! 
org.wordpress.android#102046:	  I can't upload logo...how can I get easily searched by people 
org.wordpress.android#102051:	   I can't upload my logo. Please fix it. Thank you! 
org.wordpress.android#102055:	   I love the idea of the app it's great and I can't wait to use it but it's very buggy! Especially when it comes to uploading pictures. I'm on a Galaxy s6 so my phone is compatible. Please fix this as soon as possible! 
org.wordpress.android#102056:	   Always seem to have a problem with uploading media from my phone 
org.wordpress.android#102057:	   I cant edit widgets nor delete it even after the update. Spacing is also a problem, I want a new paragraph but it connects to the previous one. Hate it until its fixed. 
org.wordpress.android#102060:	   I have issue with log in/log out. Every time I open the app it says that I have entered wrong username and password. And asks me to log in again. And sometimes it is showing error and doesn't let me to log in for 20 mins. It is so annoying. I can't track my website in time! 3 stars until it's fixed. 
org.wordpress.android#102070:	   People who visit my blog are having trouble commenting. Pls you have to fix it. Its affecting my progress badly. 
org.wordpress.android#102083:	   Can't login to self hosted site 
org.wordpress.android#102085:	   Seems good looks good but go to upload a header and the view files page doesn't open. Maybe I will start a blog about all the useless apps out there all afternoon uninstalling an app to get it to work it's happening on my Galaxy S6 also my Galaxy Tab 2 total rubbish no support 
org.wordpress.android#102086:	   I'm having problems with the latest update of this app. Once I open it by clicking on a notification, I cannot do anything else as it freezes. It's a shame, as the previous version has worked relatively well most of the times. 
org.wordpress.android#102088:	   I was working with a beta version which started to lag and hang. When I removed the beta this problem was tackled. But since a couple of weeks the app has started lagging, hanging and crashing again. I am very unhappy about this as I am now unable to use an app that worked very well. 
org.wordpress.android#102092:	  Hey, the latest version of Wordpress keeps freezing and making my phone hang. Please fix it. I even had to downgrade to an older Wordpress version. 28/5/2016 
org.wordpress.android#102097:	   Everytime I add photos on my content, it keeps distorting the text and the photos are not in place! Fix this sooner please. Very unprofessional. 
org.wordpress.android#102100:	   Lately it's not keeping me signed in. I check the box for "stay signed in" but it constantly has me log back in. Also when editing my menus from the app while on my phone, as soon as I try to drag a page to reorder the menu it automatically scrolls all the way down making it impossible. Please fix these issues and thanks. 
org.wordpress.android#102103:	   I have followed the help suggestions. No joy. Even at reduced size my image upload crashes my phone.Its so frustrating. All other apps upload images without problems 
org.wordpress.android#102107:	   Uploading photos isn't working 
org.wordpress.android#102117:	   Images can't be uploaded! Please fix it! 
org.wordpress.android#102122:	   I have a solid connection on my tablet but word press freezes constantly or won't load from the app. 
org.wordpress.android#102123:	   Now crashes out, bogging down my whole phone with it. 
org.wordpress.android#102127:	   Fix it please 
org.wordpress.android#102133:	   I generally like WordPress, however, the app has some problems. If I save a local draft with pictures and exit out of the app even for just a few seconds, the formatting goes wonky and half the pictures disappear. Now just recently, I wrote up a really long post, hit publish, and when I checked on it, it had saved as a local draft. I hit edit and the ENTIRE post disappeared. I restarted the app and my phone and it's still gone. I'm not sure I'll continue to use this app after that!! :( 
org.wordpress.android#102139:	   I like that..i can create many blog with just 1 email with this app..And i also ove that i can make my blog like it was made by computer sort of...and yeah..all beginner should try this app! Really cool..but yeah some problem like cant use the multiple pick for choosing more than 1 image for my entry/blog.....so its kinda hard..has to pick 1 by 1 .... 
org.wordpress.android#102141:	    every time I use it, and now it won't even post anything from my phone. Fix your app! 
org.wordpress.android#102144:	   I love WordPress no doubt but the application is just not right. It lags so much. It gets stuck after every second. You definitely cannot work using this application! Uninstalling it right away 
org.wordpress.android#102150:	   This new update sucks!! I can't upload images from my phone to my posts. It only shows pictures I've already uploaded from previous posts! That's no good! This renders the app useless to me. Will uninstall if this isn't fixed in the next update. 
org.wordpress.android#102153:	   I have host my domain and using Wordpress theme. But using this app i cannot login. Is there something plugin i should install ? Help me 
org.wordpress.android#102159:	   Can't login to my work site. Giving me error message. I login via my web browser without issues 
org.wordpress.android#102180:	   Edits made in the app simply do not save. If you try to report this error, all they do is refer you to a forum and then recommend uninstalling and reinstalling the app. 
org.wordpress.android#102182:	   Every post I write is accompanied with extra hours of redos, redrafts, and rewriting as the site seems to pick and choose what to keep when you hit save draft. The application never ever works without several bugs to work around. Uninstalling, logging out, force stopping, nothing works. Can't wait to switch to Squarespace. 
org.wordpress.android#102185:	  Awful. Used on self hosted site with good database but app gave nothing but refresh errors, permission errors, upload errors. Wouldn't load images either. 
org.wordpress.android#102192:	   Comments don't load anymore.. Not sure if WordPress update broke it, or app update broke it.. Have 5 WordPress self hosted sites, no comments load. Please fix this. Comments still broken, can't add multiple self hosted anymore, after adding 1 all others say error. Almost everything is breaking for self hosted WordPress sites with this app. Hope it gets fixed, used to be great app. 
org.wordpress.android#102195:	   Some freezing issue a drop action button not working. 
org.wordpress.android#102201:	   Big disappointment since the major functionality fails to work......... 
org.wordpress.android#102204:	   It always crashed since I updated the app. Help please. 
org.wordpress.android#102207:	   My WP app freezes at the home screen. As soon as I "open" the app, nothing. Deleted and re-downloaded, same problem. Latest update terrible for my Samsung Galaxy S4 
org.wordpress.android#102208:	   Why cannot I upload Images now. I keep tapping the upload media option but nothing happens. Kindly fix the issue for ( Samsung Note 5 _ os 6.0.1 
org.wordpress.android#102211:	   Keeps causing my s7 edge to crash and reboot. Tried on my gf's s7 edge too. Same thing happened. Tried on another factory reset s7 edge to same effect. This app is useless now. 
org.wordpress.android#102217:	   It's been crashing for more than a month and non of the recent updates have helped to solve the issue. 
org.wordpress.android#102218:	   The last version is not working on my redmi note 2 
org.wordpress.android#102220:	   Please fix this problem as soon as possible. 
org.wordpress.android#102223:	   As of latest update 5/6/16 app now hangs and crashes instead of doing anything. 
org.wordpress.android#102226:	  Cant able create account showing error 
org.wordpress.android#102234:	   I recently had an issue but they helped me fix the it. I do have one request for the developers. It would be nice if I could edit my posts in more of a WYSIWYG way like on the website. Right now I have to edit the HTML to make changes which can be useful, but many times more of a hassle. It's also not user friendly for anyone who doesn't know HTML5. If you could add a visual mode to the app it would be useful. The in-app support chat is excellent though. 
org.wordpress.android#102237:	   Failed to load your request token while connecting to facebook.. Please try again in a moment. Your new update is for the worst. As i cant reconnect my facebook account in automatic post sharing.. your new update really makes it much what help can you give me 
org.wordpress.android#102240:	   I Can not see my profit pic and my pages are not visible to everyone.. fix it. 
org.wordpress.android#102249:	   I am unable to upload any of my posts inspite of high data speed. Irritating! I have to switch down to older version. Fix it up ASAP! 
org.wordpress.android#102253:	   I'm new to using WordPress. I have a blog. The app lets me do everything that I need to. The most helpful thing is that I can add HTML codes in the post editing area and they actually effect. I haven't encountered the problems that others mention here, but I hope that they are fixed before I do. 
org.wordpress.android#102263:	   When you start writing a post and choose the align text tool, through Web, bug problems (codes on text) appear, if you want to resume / keep writing your post through the app. Maybe it is best, until improvements, to keep using just the Web, unfortunately 
org.wordpress.android#102273:	   Would be great if I could upload a profile picture or gravatar. Its not working. Will give 5 star once this is fixed. P.S. I first commented this in Jan. And this issues is still not fixed in April. What's up. Really want to get things rolling. 
org.wordpress.android#102274:	   Very slow to load tabs, and switch between my site, reader and settings. Sometimes it just fails to respond and stays where it is. (All this on a good internet connection that loads everything well in another web browser app). It ultimately just refused to let me go back to 'view site'. Please fix. Reverted to v4.0, which doesn't look as nice but does the work. 
org.wordpress.android#102275:	   My problem is I can't have a featured photo on my articles not like on the iOS one. My theme breaks without it 
org.wordpress.android#102281:	   I typed 193 words and it didn't save notepad is better. 
org.wordpress.android#102283:	  It's so awful. I can't even post a post all it says is 'error can't upload' 
org.wordpress.android#102288:	   But after I delete this app & download again, I can't use this app 
org.wordpress.android#102302:	   How to solve this error plz help me. an error occured while uploding the post HTTP status code 404 was returned not found. 
org.wordpress.android#102308:	  Cant upload or write to my blog. When it does work , it makes my whole website crash. Is there a reason for this ? Is there anybody I can contact for help or support?? 
org.wordpress.android#102309:	   It takes very long to Complete the loading... And even I cannot view my Site ... It always show Error " Webpage is not available " ... Is there any solution for all this Problem... I would like to give Full Stars but this conditions not possible 
org.wordpress.android#102325:	   It works most of the time, but it likes to mysteriously delete parts of a post or a whole post when publishing. I spend an hour while traveling only to have my posts constantly deleted when I'm trying to write or edit them. STAY AWAY FROM WORDPRESS IF YOU NEED TO USE YOUR PHONE FOR A BLOG...THE SITE DOESN'T WORK WELL FOR UPLOADING PHOTOS AND THE APP CONSTANTLY TRIES AND EVENTUALLY SUCCEEDS AT DELETING YOUR POSTS AND PHOTOS...STAY AWAY...FIND A DIFFERENT BLOG VENUE!!!! 
org.wordpress.android#102327:	   I downloaded this app to read a story, and I cannot find any way to actually do that! 
org.wordpress.android#102336:	   The app worked great, but since latest update, it's crashed my phone and hasn't been able to upload any of my recent posts. Please fix! 
org.wordpress.android#102340:	   Can't find icons 
org.wordpress.android#102346:	    refreshing posts and categories and post upload failed evertime 
org.wordpress.android#102349:	   Nearly everything is set neatly but can't set featured image to post/page through APP. Fix this up. Thank you. :) 
org.wordpress.android#102355:	   Getting error messages when publishing a post with images. 
org.wordpress.android#102359:	   Fix the bug as i m not able to post on app 
org.wordpress.android#102360:	  Do not download 
org.wordpress.android#102372:	   I can't login self hosted site 
org.wordpress.android#102374:	  It is not user friendly, sometimes it shows error when we click on notification. Please do upgrade 
org.wordpress.android#102376:	  I can't seem to log in. I logged in on a website and it worked but with an app it has a problem. Please solve this. Thanks. 
org.wordpress.android#102387:	   Lag so much when attached 20mb of photos in the post. To make it worse, after lagging the phone 20min to upload, it became connection error and the post cannot be uploaded! Worse of time and battery to upload. PLEASE FIX THIS BUG 
org.wordpress.android#102389:	  I like the app, only temporary issue i h ave is my media uploader dosen't work-with or without wifi  
org.wordpress.android#102390:	   I installed and had a login issue straight off but you have integrated support right there to help streamline efforts. Turns out your people discovered an issue I'd been having problems with for other things which also prevented my login. Because they helped troubleshoot things I was able to "kill two birds with one rock." The app works great and I'm pretty much your evangelist. 
org.wordpress.android#102397:	  Why is it that there's always error when uploading videos? I have videopress but it has this error everytime 
org.wordpress.android#102398:	   I can barely do anything anymore. I can't post, upload pictures or anything and if I logout I can't login again cause the login box doesn't come up 
org.wordpress.android#102399:	   I don't know what you've done for this app on the latest update, I try to change the language preferences setting to Indonesian, and all the issues that happened on previous version aren't come up on this version. The app is working very well in Indonesian mode. It's awesome. Thank You, WordPress. Thank You, Automattic. :) 
org.wordpress.android#102405:	   All my followers have disappeared. I have to re-follow from their likes. Also, if I read someone's post, then like it, it disappears. Something has gone wrong. Please fix. No I don't hate WordPress, it's an awesome app, but this is annoying. 
org.wordpress.android#102411:	   Please add the ability to edit as Visual and not only through HTML - it mostly no usefull even if i know html 
org.wordpress.android#102414:	  It is not user friendly. Cant publish post or upload pictures. 
org.wordpress.android#102418:	   I'm unable to update my self hosted WordPress website from mobile because Select Media button is not working, same problem was in previous release, after update I thought that it might be resolved but no improvement. When I install app for first time everything was good and working so I suggest same to my client's, but no solution after updates 3 times yet. 
org.wordpress.android#102422:	   Help center was not helpful at all when I experienced an error in logging in 
org.wordpress.android#102440:	  How people rate this app so highly is beyond me. This is simply one of the most awful apps out there. The interface is muddled and feels like an alpha. Going to admin is just a browser window that doesn't work as well as your browser. It has quite possibly the worst editor I've ever seen. You're better off just logging in with a browser than wasting your time on this. This is a half baked broken app. It's a good thing they don't force Android users to use the app like Evernote does, because this is atrocious. Just log in with your browser and use the web interface because its infinitely better than this. 
org.wordpress.android#102442:	   Please Resolve the problem. "An error occured while uploading media" 
org.wordpress.android#102446:	   Please fix the bug.i'm using xiaomi mi4c 
org.wordpress.android#102452:	   Always error message when I go to edit blog draft, edits are not saved either many times. Definitely moving my blog to other portal. 
org.wordpress.android#102454:	   I found some bugs in this app, first and very important bug is : image uploading is not working in this app. 
org.wordpress.android#102455:	   I like this app but I can never schedule a post. Every time I try, even today when said said "schedule" it goes ahead and publishes it instantly. PLEASE FIX THIS! 
org.wordpress.android#102460:	   I can't pick batch images from extsdcard to my blog i am obliged pick images from storage one by one and this is very time consuming , also wordpress lock is sometimes working sometimes not working and anybody can access my blog if access my tablet, i can't add background music to my blog, there is no way to add custom java codes into my blog and wordpress doesn't support it, i can't pick or upload video clip from my extsdcard to my blog, wordpress doesn't offer any free widgets to add it on blog The best apk blog is just "Blogger" .... 
org.wordpress.android#102461:	   Several problems with this app on this Asus tablet. Going to stay with browser instead. Maybe it's me, or the tablet...Then again, there seems to be about 8,000 of us giving this 1 or 2 rating. :( 
org.wordpress.android#102464:	   Terrible for my Blu life pure, it just doesn't work... I hated it. El formato es terrible para mi Blu life pure. Para escribir tengo que adivinar y tantear donde lo hago ya que la barra de herramientas ocupa toda el ea y no tienes como ocultarla. A cada rato sale una advertencia para guardar los datos por si te sales lo que des configura otra vez la pagina. Es terrible 
org.wordpress.android#102473:	   It's alright but crashes sometimes. Some parts are easier to use than directly in the web client such as looking at site statistics. 
org.wordpress.android#102480:	   Though there are still some bugs to be fixed I thinks its perfect for now...... jux work on the image upload code a bit 
org.wordpress.android#102485:	   When iam going to custom page it's not work.i can't change the option such as static front page,background etc.please develop this! 
org.wordpress.android#102486:	   There is no option to publish my article in the app anymore. I have to go on my PC to post a blog online, I never had this issue before and love this app now this is just inconvenient plz fix this now 
org.wordpress.android#102488:	   I am loving this app. Only problem is that I can't upload media to a post I just finished writing. I want to publish it but can't yet as I don't have any pictures or media on it. Please help. 
org.wordpress.android#102495:	   This ap let's you keep tabs on your blog stats, traffic,and comments pretty decently. You can change your post status which I have found helpful at times. Only real problem I've had is trying to edit previously published blogs - doesn't seem to like anything but plain text and I lose content and readability when trying to make even minor corrections to posts with pictures, bolding, etc. 
org.wordpress.android#102497:	   I'd consider myself a fairly light user, just want to do text and pics with captions on my phone as I have no PC access. Adding the pics is a nightmare: I've lately been using the multiple picker, but it doesn't recognise albums, and its very clumsy to scroll through thousands of pics. Have a workaround for that, but then changing btw apps or just scrolling up and down in editing mode results in a crash sooner or later. At my wits ends. I refuse to add pics one by one in the media library... 
org.wordpress.android#102504:	   I couldn't get it to upload media at first but I narrowed down the problem. It's not file size but dimension. Everything below 2,000 pixels uploads fine, I haven't tested anything larger. Just posting this in case you had the same problem, use an image resizer app. 
org.wordpress.android#102505:	   Using it about 6 months. But haven't face any kind of problems. Best of luck developers. 
org.wordpress.android#102506:	   After a year of use this app still doesn't work. It wont save uploaded photos, it removes posts and often wont upload until the 15th try. Way to many bugs. Have to use the web page (even though the web page version is painfully slow) 
org.wordpress.android#102517:	   The mobile app only lets you take a photo, not upload them from your gallery, so watermarking images is not an option. Won't be using this mobile app for blogging. 
org.wordpress.android#102520:	   All about error . Bye . 
org.wordpress.android#102525:	   Solve this problem it doesn't respond on my Qmobile I5I 
org.wordpress.android#102528:	   Nice app for writing blog posts on the go, checking out stats, catching up on the reader. Haven't tried adding artwork. A somewhat annoying bug: my views of my own blog from the app get counted in stats. 
org.wordpress.android#102532:	   Why I can not use the app, when I switched two step authentification? 
org.wordpress.android#102534:	   Blogger app just can't compete with all the features of WordPress. While it had failed me a few times while uploading it is still head and shoulders above the rest. 
org.wordpress.android#102537:	   After I tap View site I'm getting  and it says I do not have permissions. It started after 5.x versions update. How can I fix it? 
org.wordpress.android#102538:	  Login works on desktop but not in app, gotta be fixed 
org.wordpress.android#102542:	  Sorry, but it did not work 
org.wordpress.android#102548:	   I have had enough of my photos being moved around when I go out og the Blog editor and then back into it. It moves photos in the middle of sentences. Just went back into it after my phone battery ran out and the last three hours of editing a blog post was lost! I've contact WordPress about this bug before and was told to update, which I've done twice since and nothing has changed. I'm moving to a different blog provider. Pathetic! 
org.wordpress.android#102554:	   whenever I try to start a blog,it crashes. Fix it plzzz asap. :) 
org.wordpress.android#102555:	   Please fix to upload all type of files. Only images and video files can upload from this app. Please fix the problem. I will give 5 stars when my wish is fulfilled 
org.wordpress.android#102563:	  Unable to log in with a self-hosted site on the last 2 updates. I've had to go back to 4.8.1 in order for the app to work for me. 1 star for that, 4 stars for how well it works with 4.8.1 PS: I have tried going through support. Could never get it to work. This applies to a Samsung Galaxy S5, an HTC phone, and 2 different tablets. Anything past 4.8.1 doesn't work 
org.wordpress.android#102568:	   keep re-downloading on my galaxy note edge and then it said download failed. 
org.wordpress.android#102569:	  fail to insert foto 
org.wordpress.android#102571:	   Can't unlink images. Every image will open when clicked. I can't find a way to keep an image from becoming an image link. 
org.wordpress.android#102574:	  Tried updating my post by adding pics to it using the app, and it failed, twice. When I click on updating, it shows me - Upload 1/3 pics, and then when it reaches the 3rd pic, my mobile restarts. First time I thought it might be issue with mobile, then it happened again. The mobile is fully charged and hence i wasn't expecting this to happen. 
org.wordpress.android#102580:	   I can't upload a profile pic. Tsk. This is unfair. Gravatar is not helping. 
org.wordpress.android#102584:	   But i have problem my posts is not shown in browser.. 
org.wordpress.android#102585:	   After installing this app I had nothing but problems. With my self hosted site. Wouldn't upload media in posts. Wouldn't log in properly. ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED more times than I can remember leaving my site inn accessible for about 20 minutes. I give up uninstalling go back to the computer! 
org.wordpress.android#102587:	   I have a blog on WordPress , so naturally I got the app - had an issue on my blog , no way of contacting WordPress ...only forums to ask ...considering it's a paid service , it's not good ! - thank you for your reply ! 
org.wordpress.android#102594:	   The app fails to refresh new blog posts since the last update 
org.wordpress.android#102595:	   Looks great but the photo upload still does not work. Even if u just want to use something from the media gallery it does not work well. Same issue as a year ago... 
org.wordpress.android#102606:	   Good work in making app, but has some bugs. 
org.wordpress.android#102609:	   Notification are not updated , very laggy, slow , changed altered are not taken place .. many things to fix ..pleas fix this and make this app work proper.. 
org.wordpress.android#102610:	   Why it always error if i upload pictures? Please fix that. 
org.wordpress.android#102616:	   Wordpress hasn't secure, it can be easily hack by hacker, not more attractive templates and low stroage of upload files. i hope you will solve this problems in next update 
org.wordpress.android#102621:	   We can mentain our Daily issues, problems and solutions. 
org.wordpress.android#102622:	   Major problem with self hosted sites... Simply doesn't work. 
org.wordpress.android#102625:	  Good app. But sometimes there errors occured. Typically it can't refresh post when my network connect is exellent and all my other apps work well. 
org.wordpress.android#102626:	   When I make some changes on my post like adding a photo because I forgot to add one. It is saying an error occur while uploading in media. And it is saying that changes are made locally. I don't understand. Please help me. I tried publishing it all over again but still changes are not occurring. I'll add more stars if this will be fix.. thanks anyways for this app! 
org.wordpress.android#102631:	  Not much use - very disappointing. You log into your 'self-hosted' site and none of the in-app functionality seems to work. 'Couldn't refresh at this time' keeps being shown. Instead you need to view the website and then use the normal dashboard, but on a small screen. I could do that in any browser. Please fix the refresh issue. 
org.wordpress.android#102632:	  It keeps crashing on me. I have 18 WordPress sites and this only started happening in the last few days 
org.wordpress.android#102633:	   This thing used to work but after the update , I am unable to post pictures. Gives me an error saying "An error occurred while uploading the Post HTTP status code: 403 was returned. Forbidden". I love the app, so please fix!! 
org.wordpress.android#102634:	   I hate logging in to Wordpress. It says I have the wrong password. I reset it. Try to login and wrong password. I have reset password 4  today. wish there was customer service. I used the new password to login to wordpress on my labtop and the "wrong password user name combo" worked there. But it says I have no website yet. I liked this app because it would remember passwords. but everycouple months the app stops working and will not upload posts correct. Now I uninstalled app and reintalled app. 
org.wordpress.android#102636:	  i have tried two phones sony xperia m4 and Alcatel idol 3 the app doesn't work on them for self hosted site , they have lollipop 5.02 ,but it works on my old tablet acer on jellybean 4.1 so please fix this. 
org.wordpress.android#102644:	   This app is ok. The end results can be great if you are patient, but the whole interface is just painful, and I end up putting off updating my blog because I know it is going to be a hassle. There seem to be so many different areas to the app, all of which allow you to edit a post for example, but each with a slightly different interface and different features and options. Yesterday I was previewing a post, found a mistake so clicked edit and went into a completely different editor, which allowed media insertion direct from hard drive rather than having to upload to library first. And now I can't find it. Could be great but is too messy and bitty. Typical piece of software written by a large company with lots of developers who don't talk to each other, and no one person with an overview of what it is really like to use. 
org.wordpress.android#102653:	   Spent so much time changing from blogger to WP and noone could fix the problem of my site getting no traffic. Deleted. 
org.wordpress.android#102656:	   I can't login to my account even doing what I was asked to do via the support staff 
org.wordpress.android#102662:	   Everything is good even best but I can't upload files. When I do there is no reaction. Plzz fix this bug 
org.wordpress.android#102663:	   Damn. I keep on clicking "upload files" or "select files" but it wont let me choose pictures or any files! I was trying to change the header of my theme but that button wouldn't let me do it! please fix this. 
org.wordpress.android#102690:	   This app keeps deleting my drafts and I had to type the same stuff Oover and over again. It also deletes my pictures non-stop and I had to insert and insert until I get mad. Please fix this 
org.wordpress.android#102694:	   I use the app frequently to write while I am traveling. I just spent an hour to compose an article. I needed to check a link on chrome and went back to the main menu. It said local draft saved. I looked up what I needed and went back into the app. In the preview the pictures have been scrambled with the text, an issue I had observed already, which I did not really care about that much. When I tried to edit it, there was no more content, everything gone except for the heading. Everything was deleted. 
org.wordpress.android#102706:	  app had serious issue. I write my post and click on update button but lost all data because got error to update data. App should save data into local before updating to server. Please fix this issue. 
org.wordpress.android#102707:	   I love this app. But when I want to edit a draft, it shows in html format, which is very inconvenient. Solve this issue and you will get 5 stars for this awesome blogging platform. 
org.wordpress.android#102711:	  Lov the simple interface but hate the part of copyright issue. 
org.wordpress.android#102716:	   App crashes after sign in. Just a waste of MB downloading it 
org.wordpress.android#102724:	   Great app to post entries, control comments and view stats while traveling or running errands. Never had any problems. :) 
org.wordpress.android#102725:	  Love how the team were quick at fixing issues and giving support. 
org.wordpress.android#102729:	   Cant moderate comments in rply to any comment...everytime it shows "error while moderating comment" And plz add font size options in post writing...and sum more useful content writing settings. 
org.wordpress.android#102731:	  I have stopped getting notifications when someone likes my posts please fix! 
org.wordpress.android#102736:	   I have a galaxy 6 edge plus, and I can't upload pictures from my phone. Will change rating when problem is fixed 
org.wordpress.android#102739:	   Login error to wpcom and wp self hosting.... 
org.wordpress.android#102748:	   Can't work out how to actually post my first one. Help 
org.wordpress.android#102763:	   I love this app. I publish without any problem. 
org.wordpress.android#102767:	   when I upload a photo and try to post it it's saying that "An error occured while uploading the media"I don't know why it say but I want it's solution.Plz developer,give it's solution.Thank u :) 
org.wordpress.android#102771:	   I use to have the app until i unistalled it and now im trying to get it back but it wont download please fix this issue thanks 
org.wordpress.android#102774:	  Bugs 
org.wordpress.android#102775:	  It's just not working. I somehow can't post my posts. 
org.wordpress.android#102777:	   Cannot upload my profile picture. 
org.wordpress.android#102781:	  It show error uploading fix it 
org.wordpress.android#102788:	   Where did the option to follow a blog go? And I can't access to the blogs that I follow, to which I had access earlier. 
org.wordpress.android#102794:	   I can not login because no verify code sent to my phone. 
org.wordpress.android#102796:	   Good app however I couldn't get the oldest post when I search a relevant tag. It would be nice if there's a filter as well and if there's an index tab for us to easily search what we are looking for, just like in the desktop website. Hope it can apply as well n the app. Thanks. :) 
org.wordpress.android#102802:	   Here are the problems with this app on my Nexus 7: I can't upload photos through the app. I have to use the browser version and upload one at a time. Very annoying if I want to put 20-30 photos in a post. If the orientation of my tablet changes, the app resets to the dashboard and you lose what you were working on. The cursor sometimes behaves very strangely when typing, so you end up with one word insianotherde, like that. All of these things make creating a post a slow and frustrating process. 
org.wordpress.android#102811:	  Worked perfectly on my Galaxy S4, but since upgrading to a S6 I can't get it to connect to my self hosted site. 
org.wordpress.android#102824:	  Ok. But select files not work. import posts not work. View images broblem. Too slow in 3G.(just work 4G and fast wifi). 
org.wordpress.android#102837:	   Media error sometime comes. And please add search button in blog posts section. 
org.wordpress.android#102848:	   Private or password locked function does not work when you tap on 'view blog posts'. In the event of 2 administrators, we are able to see a preview of the posts even when we password locked the post. Also, it will be great if you could add in the feature that allows email notifications when administrators add a new post. Currently it is limited to only comments of individual posts. Thanks!! 
org.wordpress.android#102850:	   Nice application definitely deserves 5 but some small features like posting XML code does not work. 
org.wordpress.android#102853:	   I have no internet inside the app. It won't let me upload a blog or anything. Please fix. 
org.wordpress.android#102856:	   Layout is outdated and does not work well on android 
org.wordpress.android#102857:	  Cant sign in. Password error. I sign in on the pc version, here i cant 
org.wordpress.android#102858:	   I would very much like to be able to see changes I make to a draft on my phone when I access the site on my PC. No point having the app if the only way I can see posts I typed up on my phone is when I hit publish. Hope this issue is resolved soon. 
org.wordpress.android#102879:	   Wordpress never should of been converted to Android. It's terrible, clunky, The visuals are appalling, No choice in what you ACTUALLY WANT, Limited options in theme as pretty much of them are all the same, every 20 freezes and crashes, Makes your device extremely laggy, Avg Reported it as Malware and is possibly one of the worst apps I've ever used. 
org.wordpress.android#102885:	   Login info doesn't work when I know it's right. Can't reset with just an email either. This app is useless. 
org.wordpress.android#102900:	   Mobile app does not have any options to add keywords,meta tags, meta description. it uses the default meta tags from the website. which I don't want to, I want a different meta tag for each articles, we should get this access from mobile app, also (Using Yoast plug-in) it is usless to use Mobile publishing because it will be without SEP, simple no Yoast no SEP on article, thus making my articles on Google page 3-4 which is of no use, so keeping it shot please introduce SEO options in this app. 
org.wordpress.android#102901:	   This app works most of the time. Slow loading sometimes and ive had problems adding photos to my website on the mobile app, though that source is most convenient. Easy to navigate, and simple to make website changes. 
org.wordpress.android#102904:	  i cant post after format my phone,its not loading my feeds and posts, 
org.wordpress.android#102906:	  It can't run fluently on Sony Xperia Z1 
org.wordpress.android#102916:	   That could be a problem for someone who wants to get to the dashboard of their site lol. 
org.wordpress.android#102919:	  Does not open on all devices 
org.wordpress.android#102928:	  I can't upload any pictures or media? 
org.wordpress.android#102934:	   Auto jumping out of dashboard. Must be a small bug but it needs fixing. Haven't been able to work on the go and can't have full access to wordpress features on the browser. 
org.wordpress.android#102936:	  The display is awful. When I try viewing my site by the function "View Site", it displays only a quarter of the screen, which is very narrow and hard to follow the whole post. The remained screen contains my blog name's, the "sign out" button and that's it. Please kindly fix it by either try make the display as fully as when browsing on the computer or widen the screen of post in "View site" function. 
org.wordpress.android#102937:	   The app is awesome, the ability to personalise your blog is subpar anything you can find on any other app. But there seems to be a major problem.I can't login even after trying a dozen times and when I do login, I can't access my posts or anything at all. Apart from that I can't edit my posts because the process never completes. I'm not sure why this happens but I noticed that it works slightly better when using WiFi instead of mobile data. I tried using other apps and they all work fine.  
org.wordpress.android#102943:	   I'm quite satisfied of the blog as a customer, but as an admin the site is awful. When I want to copy some of my text or even write a new page or article, the first screen thumbtouch engaging keypad, it goes to top page? When I want to change for example title menu it refresh for each single letter??? And there are few problems which i'm also not entirely satisfied. Can you fix it please? This app doesn't fit on android phone, moreover since nothing has been fixed, I changed to 1 star 
org.wordpress.android#102944:	   can't upload my profile picture throw gravater error coming a week ago I'll try and still it's not working please fixe it . 
org.wordpress.android#102951:	   Online and in mobile I'm asked for a verification code, but I never receive it. It refers to an authenticator mobile application, which I can't find. What's even more amusing is that the online help requires me to login with this code before makingr a help request... So I'm unable to use my account, or get help. Interestingly enough, the rest password sends me a mail to my email address. 
org.wordpress.android#102959:	   Always get errors when trying to create new posts; can't refresh media library or categories list. Still after several updates, can't update categories list when creating a new post :( 
org.wordpress.android#102984:	   Last bug doesn't save changes, 2 stars. 1 star for new bug , thank you Automattic, now you give me duplicate post and when I delete 1 post then refresh, guess what? Both posts disappeared, no where to be found. Trash folder is all empty but when I delete a post on web, it move to Trash folder. Here's a tip: Don't write app if you can't even know how to! Now I lost my post forever thank to a bunch of lazy developer at Automattic. Is this app automatic delete my post too? Won't test this for you. 
org.wordpress.android#102998:	  I can't get to logging using blogspot please help resolve the issue 
org.wordpress.android#102999:	   I make a post with 35 pics with captions and I try to upload. After failing upload I go to my posts and find that the entire post had been deleted. So now I can start again and redo everything. Please fix bug. 
org.wordpress.android#103005:	   When disconnected 1 time during the upload... It not able to keep uploading when connected back again... It s bugging the app and freezes and the device restarts itself (it s in the draft uploading for ever... Even restarting the device is not helping... Removing the app and reinstall helps though) ... Big definition video doesn't resize automatically depending on the theme of the website. Updating an existing post is not wysiwyg, modifying a video after posted is impossible... This app is full of bugs. 
org.wordpress.android#103008:	   I love the app but I've had to use the computer version because I can not get my reader to update it keeps saying that it is unable to retrieve new posts I've tried restarting the app I've tried un-installing it and then redownloading it but not thing please fix and I'll change my rating 
org.wordpress.android#103009:	   It used to work flawlessly, now it only uploads and syncs 98% of the time. 2% of the time it works. Viewing stats is possible, so it's not completely useless - just 98% useless. XML-RPC is enabled, the problem is the app. 
org.wordpress.android#103014:	  Cannot login to my self-hosted server. 
org.wordpress.android#103019:	   I cant upload my picture for gravatar on personal information. Fix that button upload picture 
org.wordpress.android#103026:	   Suddenly i can't open the application. Please fix it 
org.wordpress.android#103028:	   As a professional writer and Author, my blog is vital to my career as it allows me to keep in touch with my growing community of fans. At times I do not have access to a laptop and would appreciate an app that actually works and allows me to check and manage my blog, to which I pay for the domain server. I fail to see how this app has median average of about 4-stars considering it fails to function properly. From Author J. Adam Snyder 
org.wordpress.android#103037:	   Good job. Thanks for Developers. But picture upload to media is failure. Upload not complete. Please fix the problem. Sincerely Ramin Cabbarly 
org.wordpress.android#103038:	   I really love this application, but it could be very  and Helpful if can search for old post instead of scrolling scrolling down... And also fix .PNG image transparent turn to black if insert image.... At the same time, Thanks! WordPress 
org.wordpress.android#103053:	   I'm trying to login and it'll automatically log me back out. I've tried unistalling the app and reinstalling the app. That didn't work. I would just like to login into my account and update my blog. 
org.wordpress.android#103059:	   Uninstalling this because it requires the use of XML-RPC on your site. XML-RPC has been shown recently to be vulnerable to hackers which is why I've disabled it on my sites. Unfortunately, it looks like I'll never be able to use this app because the developers are uninterested in addressing the issue. 
org.wordpress.android#103063:	  I try to log on to my account and then logs on, but than it immediately logs off. Can you fix the bug problem please. I would gladly appreciate it 
org.wordpress.android#103079:	   If I click Stats or view site the app get crashed 
org.wordpress.android#103081:	   I would have give 5 stars for this app but you'll need to fix the upload plugin function first 
org.wordpress.android#103091:	  Can't login to my self hosted blog. Tried the url and the url/wp-admin :/ 
org.wordpress.android#103092:	   Continuous media error message 
org.wordpress.android#103096:	   Can't upload images click media and says I have none. I have hundreds of photos what's the point of a blog if I can not upload photos! 
org.wordpress.android#103097:	  l could not upload my profile picture but otherwise its a great app 
org.wordpress.android#103102:	   Allows me to log into a self-hosted site, but it behaves erratically, images randomly don't appear and I can only edit in HTML mode. Media uploads failing for no apparent reason. 
org.wordpress.android#103108:	   After the blog is saved as draft, it would not give in to re-editing to complete, let alone to be published. Does not work for my Huawei Android. 
org.wordpress.android#103109:	   i can't add images from my gallery. i can add from existing media but there seems a problem to upload media from my phone gallery. is it just my phone or with all? I hope it is fixed soon! 
org.wordpress.android#103111:	   Cannot edit existing posts in visual mode... And also cannot remove hyperlinks from text... 
org.wordpress.android#103112:	   All the posts for Self-hosted sites keeps loosing their given categories when a "Publish" button is pressed to post new Articles or "Update" button to update content and keeps sending them to "Uncategorized"....plz fix this asap! 
org.wordpress.android#103113:	   I tried to make an account but I am not able to make it,even after I tried consistently but it says an error occurred. I also tried to take app help support that also not responding. Please help me 
org.wordpress.android#103114:	   needs serious fixing 
org.wordpress.android#103122:	   After recent update, when I press view site it is not opening... 
org.wordpress.android#103124:	  I loved WordPress when I first got it but just today, I have written two long blogs and it didn't save either one. I am updating the app now in hopes that out has been improved. 
org.wordpress.android#103125:	   1) it's missing a search field. 2) no multi select and upload of multiple images from a single folder, it's either messy all together or one by one. 3) I lost the whole text and images of a new post because of an internet connection error, this should not happen no matter how bad the connection is, offline editing is what users expect from an application vs the web-admin! 4) post settings button is hidden when keyboard is open 5) can't edit site url 6) can't batch upload local charges 
org.wordpress.android#103126:	   I have issues inserting photos in to my posts through the app. I also can't view my notifications through the app. 
org.wordpress.android#103145:	  Great app but one problem: can't share in a Facebook page. You can only share on your own wall, on a friend's wall and in a group. Used to be able to share in a page but for some reasons we can't do that now. Please fix as soon as possible 
org.wordpress.android#103159:	  It's OK. But on viewing my draft to see if it looks OK to post I get a big pop up I can't get rid of saying it has no notifications yet(of course it doesn't. IT'S A DRAFT). Please get rid of this or give it an x button so I can get rid of this annoying notification as I can't see if the layout of the post works! 
org.wordpress.android#103165:	   Thing now crashes if I try to write anything. It happens every other time they update. Why don't they test these things! 
org.wordpress.android#103172:	   I really love this App, as it allows me to moderate and reply to comments on my blog. Plus, I get to keep up with blogs that I follow while on the go. *update* I've tried to open notifications all day and they won't open. Some aren't even showing up. I knew that I shouldn't have installed that update. Please fix! 
org.wordpress.android#103173:	   Rubbish. My notifications are disappearing and I can't open the ones I see. What's going on! 
org.wordpress.android#103174:	   With the update it wont let me in! Everytime i enter the verification code, it will not stick! I wish i hadn't updated!!!!!And I can't access notifications anymore! 
org.wordpress.android#103175:	   Cannot open notifications in application. 
org.wordpress.android#103179:	   Hoping the dev team could help me...it says, "media error occured" 
org.wordpress.android#103185:	   I use this app to blog while working full time and I can no longer broadcast posts using the app on my phone. Constantly coming up with a server error but I've had it checked! Very annoyed. Why work for months then suddenly stop? What am I missing. Also regularly only saves changes as local changes rather than uploading to the server! 
org.wordpress.android#103192:	   Can't upload images/media files. Not able to browse gallery for uploading... 
org.wordpress.android#103193:	  Was able to connect to my personally hosted blog. Everything looks pretty good, but the Featured Image setting doesn't work. I add an image from my Media Library, then edit its properties...Check the box for "Featured Image" and then leave the box for "Show in post" unchecked, but it always just shows the image in the post and refuses to set it as the Featured image, no matter how many times I go back and try to edit it/redo it. Unfortunately, that was the main function I was hoping to use, so pretty worthless to me. 
org.wordpress.android#103196:	   It doesn't upload any picture please fix it 
org.wordpress.android#103202:	   I initially loved this app but it is one of the least reliable apps I use on a regular basis. All the cool features are of no use if I cannot even edit a post. 
org.wordpress.android#103207:	  So wordpress decided to log me oit a few days back and that's it. No matter how many times I try it won't log me back in. I know my username and password is right because I logged in on the web just yesterday. Another thing, it won't let me schedule or post a draft. Very annoying. WP kindly fix this. 
org.wordpress.android#103221:	   It shows how much like the posts get but it shows also users which doesn't look beautiful under the post with some little image of users who like posts. Its irritable. Will give 5 star if wordpress can fix it! 
org.wordpress.android#103224:	   I can not upload images after upgrading to android 6.0 marsmallow in Nexus 5 phone, please fix this problem. It works and fun, thanks for the update :) 
org.wordpress.android#103230:	   I get the message, but when I try to open it to see the comment, I get an error message. It happens everrryyy time. Can only see the comments if I enter through the website. No point in having the app. 
org.wordpress.android#103234:	   Why ? I reinstalled but i can't log in. Please fix it 
org.wordpress.android#103237:	   Hi! This update have a bug with Tajik Cyrillic 
org.wordpress.android#103240:	   But this recent update hides the share button after post unless you edit the post again. Fix that please and you get a five star from me. 
org.wordpress.android#103242:	   For me this is an important feature as i like to record where it is i've been traveling. Still buried and can't default to on slightly buried the new set up doesn't work with postcodes and wont let me view a map to confirm correct location. Why not use a small map and overlay crosshairs to allow confirmation or manual alteration? 
org.wordpress.android#103243:	   Holy hell man i only made one post and i went to publish another and it crashed, and everything i just worked on disappeared. Like wtf man ur app sucks! 
org.wordpress.android#103248:	   I love wordpress but not for this apps. Having problem when I try to upload content and photos 
org.wordpress.android#103249:	   ...do you NOT allow me to log in even though my password is correct? Sure i get to log in for a few SECONDS then *poof!* you log me out again! Why?! AND!!! When i try posting something, you say that because of an error of some sorts, you cant upload my post.. And there's even NO media attached! *SOB!* and to think I was gonna restart my love for blogging &gt;_&lt; 
org.wordpress.android#103251:	   i am a heavy wordpress user and for months now I noticed that whenever I update, the content goes on to html view. I cant update my blogs normally on my phone. very frustrating. the updates suck. fix the gui first. 
org.wordpress.android#103263:	   After I select trash on my post, I can't find it again. Is there any way to restore? 
org.wordpress.android#103270:	   For some reason for the last 2 updates the push notifications for new messages in not working. 
org.wordpress.android#103273:	   Sometimes the content in the app doesn't sync with the desktop very well. 
org.wordpress.android#103276:	   Working with Marshmallow. Now can't insert media files. Please fix asap! 
org.wordpress.android#103279:	   Nice app but I can't login anymore? How do I get support for this issue? 
org.wordpress.android#103286:	  Not opening view site and close automaticly 
org.wordpress.android#103291:	   This app is absolutely horrific. It is so confusing. The website itself is pretty awful but the app is terrible. It is not user friendly at all. I am 20 years old and use new technology every single day for my major and job. My college recently made students create a WordPress blog and post as homework. I have not met one single student who even remotely enjoys the website. There is a reason nobody I know used WordPress until it became mandatory. I hate every minute of using this website and app. 
org.wordpress.android#103295:	   Can't login. 
org.wordpress.android#103297:	   This used to be a really nice app until I got the latest update. It's slow, loads very few posts on the reader and when it hangs while I'm using it, other people can't access my site! I simply hate and I advice you not to update your app if your still using the old version. . . Oh, and another thing, you can't view all your followers and the stats area is just complicated and useless. They have also removed the widgets area 
org.wordpress.android#103298:	  The app is fine for getting a quick update of your stats, but I'm finding it is quite buggy for making posts. Produces and error when adding images and sometimes loses whole posts. 
org.wordpress.android#103302:	   I love this app. I really do. But for some reason it's not uploading my posts. I've been sitting here for fifteen minutes waiting for it to finally decide to upload, but no dice. I even uninstalled then reinstalled the app. It's still. Not. WORKING. 
org.wordpress.android#103303:	   Many crash and can't upload pictures after last update, please correct it 
org.wordpress.android#103306:	   This app has been giving tons of error lately. Can't upload image to post, sometimes it says wrong password to correct password. It crashes all the time. Fix all these things pls 
org.wordpress.android#103311:	   Updates I made are out of sync. View Site button is not showing all kinds of updates that I made and I know my changes were submitted. There are multiple pathways to make changes, but that is no use, because I don't know which is the one that will work. It keeps loading comments in a pop-up in front of my page and I can't close it! 
org.wordpress.android#103313:	  I can't find a way to justify the alignment for my posts. 
org.wordpress.android#103318:	   I can't count how many times I've spent hours writing a post only to have it vanish just because I rotate to screen from vertical to horizontal. WHY DOES THE APP REFRESH JUST BECAUSE THE ORIENTATION OF MY PHONE CHANGES???? So sad that such a powerhouse such as WordPress puts their reputation on such a terrible app. Fix the orientation issue please. 
org.wordpress.android#103328:	   Why was WordPress came as app? Previous version was quite simple, easy and worked for mobile with even 2G. You know the facts about mobile internet speeds. The newer version has many cons. Please remove image preview under each post listing as it takes much time for me to navigate to Older post even when I am on WiFi, it doesn't even load on mobile with 2G or 3G. Graphically its good but ground reality is that I have stop accessing my sites from WordPress mobile app. I Rolled back to Older Version via APK. 
org.wordpress.android#103332:	   I didn't say hate it, because it is sort of cool, but it takes FOREVER to get signed in. And if you are not English or whatever, you can't eve change the language. My advice please don't get it, or else you will have to change your sign up sheet 10 times. 
org.wordpress.android#103338:	   This new one is so bad. I can not read what I write because of some error with my Vietnamese font. 
org.wordpress.android#103341:	   This apps isn't work 
org.wordpress.android#103342:	   Liked the app prior to last update. Ever since, can't sign in & no explanations or error msg. Just keeps popping back to sign in screen. Tried clearing data & uninstall/reinstall with no luck. What's the problem? Happens with both my blogs & no matter which device I try. 
org.wordpress.android#103343:	   I can't get it to work. I get SSL errors with my self hosted WordPress 4.1 with a free SSL cert from StartCom. Clicking Yes on the error does no good, it just pops up another SSL error, then another, on forever, never actually making any progress. Clicking No obviously doesn't fix it, and Details just pops up a blank screen with a title at the top. 
org.wordpress.android#103344:	   Please fix 
org.wordpress.android#103346:	  Reader is not working fine. It's stuck with 4 days ago posts. 
org.wordpress.android#103348:	   It keeps deleting my posts, and costing me a ton of time. I'm not sure why but it's done this TWICE now. Not sure I can continue to use word press to blog because of these awful issues 
org.wordpress.android#103349:	  Latest versions have serious problems with my self-hosted blog. Whats wrong. Posts are not updated and i got err_refuse_connection error message. Please fix it. I used to work with this app 
org.wordpress.android#103352:	   The app is great for on the go and for those such as me who don't have a computer at home. The only thing I have a problem with is that I can't seem to view my site because the options get in the way. Anything I can do about this? 
org.wordpress.android#103355:	   Laggy, sticky side menu, slow to respond and prone to crashing. Works fine on my phone, no complaints, but the tablet version is useless. (Asus ME173X, running Android 4.2.2) 
org.wordpress.android#103359:	   Thank you for the tip! I got it working. Still can't login to this App from since I got it weeks ago and still after all the updates. I am using the same username and password that I use to access my WordPress website on my computer. 
org.wordpress.android#103360:	   It's good but some more improvements required such as edit post quickly...... I am using wp but when I trying to edit previous post,option shows but not edit another problem is setting, view site,user options not working and site stats shows too late please upgrade it's suddenly. 
org.wordpress.android#103366:	  Still can't read posts which are protected and the problem with the font 
org.wordpress.android#103367:	   It still has stability issues on publishing with self hosted sites. 
org.wordpress.android#103369:	   Created my wp site on computer. Downloaded this and can't log in. Also major security errors with all wp sites. What's up with that. Makes me think something fishy. I'll figure it out in forum. Evidently others can't log in. 
org.wordpress.android#103379:	   I have been having problems with uploading images. The layout is also pretty glitchy on this phone. I also noticed that it is really slow now. I have so many problems with this app that I would rather use the site now. 
org.wordpress.android#103380:	  It's not working on my phone earlier version worked 
org.wordpress.android#103384:	   Do not install this app it loses your whole blog, it disheartens you, it is a waste of space don't even try. Fix that bug and i will rate five stars for you. 
org.wordpress.android#103387:	   Can't upload photos when I click on upload media nothing shows up 
org.wordpress.android#103388:	   It's now 4 stars because I loose my drafts whenever I log out. Recently changed my deviced and I lost my stuff - not fair. Fix that and it's 5 stars all the way. I love the interface now. Feels fluid. 
org.wordpress.android#103391:	   Have been having problem posting pictures and also making some adjustments on the settings 
org.wordpress.android#103393:	   Posts won't upload, constantly getting a media error 
org.wordpress.android#103404:	  It was really great, but recently I was working on a post. It took about a week to write, I was going to post it today, and it was gone. Totally wiped out. I now have to write the whole thing over. I'm so mad! It wouldn't sync when I logged in on my PC. This needs to be fixed! 
org.wordpress.android#103408:	   I can't access any of my blog pages or posts from my phone. It doesn't matter if I am on my app or on my browser. It used to work perfectly and I loved it. Feeling frustrated 
org.wordpress.android#103427:	   Is it just with me or is anyone else facing a similar issue with their follow button? I can't seem to follow any one from the reader itself. I have to go view their site in the chrome explorer and follow them from there. I'm worried others might have the same problem following me! Please help and get an update faster! 
org.wordpress.android#103432:	   When app works it is absolutely fine- annoying that your blog posts aren't in posted / scheduled / drafts. On my acer tablet the app constantly crashes when opened- very very bad. 
org.wordpress.android#103433:	   Brings me to my dashboard after loging in but immediately logs out after literally 2 seconds. Fix this please! 
org.wordpress.android#103441:	   It's good but some more improvements required such as edit post quickly...... I am using wp but when I trying to edit previous post,option shows but not edit another problem is setting, view site,user options not working and site stats shows too late please upgrade it's suddenly. 
org.wordpress.android#103442:	   Love, love WP and gearing up to leave town and blog not on my desktop. Oh no! Can't blog with only crashes.  
org.wordpress.android#103443:	   When I turn my phone or tablet sideways, I loose all of my previous work. I try to "save as draft" but have no means of recalling said draft. So, after an hour of work and editing, if my phone slips, it is all gone. Please look into this and I will be happy to fix my review. 
org.wordpress.android#103444:	   If you draft a post with media, save it and then go back to work on it later you will find that there are duplicates in your media file. While working in limited and expensive internet countries this is a real bug bear. I won't be using this app until they fix it. 
org.wordpress.android#103446:	   This used to be a good app but now it struggles to be stable. After viewing stats or notifications the app freezes and Android prompts me to kill it. This has happened on my tablet and now my phone. I'll give this a higher rating when the issue is resolved. 
org.wordpress.android#103448:	   Very difficult app, too much options; media uploading issue. Developer Needs to better the app. 
org.wordpress.android#103455:	   It has so many problems. 
org.wordpress.android#103464:	   I cant follow anyone. I tried restarting app.. Help? Resolve the issue and I'll change to 5 stars. 
org.wordpress.android#103468:	   This app used to be a lot better! Get constant server errors when trying to simply view the site or access admin, among other issues. I host multiple WP sites and I know they are all functional. However, you can manage and add posts, etc. So, there's that. 
org.wordpress.android#103477:	  It crashes EVERY TIME I open it. Hate it 
org.wordpress.android#103478:	   ...but unfortunately it crashes nearly every time I use it. 
org.wordpress.android#103484:	   It keep reloading, not loading my post, and is not like dis BFORE d new update is bad for me 
org.wordpress.android#103486:	   The follow button doesn't work and the choosing image file for profile picture doesn't work. 
org.wordpress.android#103487:	   The app never used to crash and now it crashes at least once or twice everyday. Also, the notifications used to appear instantly and now while the push up notification notifies me that there are comments on my blog, the notifications feed doesn't show those comments. I have to now go to my App Settings and Force Stop the app and open it again each time it crashes or the notifications don't show up. Sorry to have to delete it but I can't work with a faulty app. Please fix it. 
org.wordpress.android#103489:	   This is the worst app ever. Every time I access it, literally every single time, it crashes. After the recent update, it has become unusable. It only notifies me of maybe 10% of the comments and crashes every time I try to access them. It also crashes whenever I try to post anything. I have never seen an app so bad in my life. 
org.wordpress.android#103494:	   I have a self hosted WP install. This app crashes every time i try to connect it. 
org.wordpress.android#103496:	   Once I found wordpress had an app I was so excited. I could write, post, and share right from app. Now I can't share and it is really frustrating. Please fix this asap! Oh and I did finally figure out there is a share button, but it only shares what is selected,not the whole post!! 
org.wordpress.android#103500:	  I think the biggest problem with WordPress is the lack of optimization services. It seems as if the creator of this app was pleased with him self for putting an exact replica of the website on a mobile screen. But apps are supposed to be an optimal, functional and simplistic experience that promotes on the go usage. 
org.wordpress.android#103501:	   The old problem with crashing and freezing is back again, can't even post without it freezing on me. 
org.wordpress.android#103506:	   Loved this app until it updated and now I can't share my post with any of my other social media apps. Would give it 5 stars but I won't until they fix it to be able to share ur posts with other apps 
org.wordpress.android#103509:	   Takes a little getting use to as far as editing and building the page goes. I'm not That computer literate but for those who are might not find it difficult. Other than that I find it to suit my needs. 
org.wordpress.android#103511:	   Can't upload any image in the app...plz fix it soon 
org.wordpress.android#103512:	   Whenever I try to add tags and categories, the app gets hanged. Repeatedly tried it and still does not work. Kindly look into it. Samsung E5, Lollipop. 
org.wordpress.android#103514:	   This app saved a different version of one of my posts than I had saved on WordPress on my computer. I published my article on my phone and an unfinished version of the post was published. I lost the rest of my article. I'm in tears as I was supposed to release my website today but will have to wait until a reasonable time tomorrow if I'm not working too much that is. 
org.wordpress.android#103522:	   I can't upload my photo on my post!!! After uploading, there's no image coming out!!! Please help to fix it as soon as possible!!!! ! 
org.wordpress.android#103524:	  Had to do a factory reset of my phone and when it came to logging in again on the WP app noticed changes. Can't upload pictures now - deleting. When will you learn, some updates are worthless and don't really create for user satisfaction! 
org.wordpress.android#103531:	   , but i can't even upload a profile picture *sweat drops* please fix! 
org.wordpress.android#103532:	   The newest update screwed up a few features. I can't caption pictures anymore, sometimes pictures don't load or upload, blog list doesn't refresh properly anymore, no easy way to share links. There's more 
org.wordpress.android#103551:	  I love this app, it gets a little buggy when writing a post on my phone, but all the admin work is a dream! One thing though, I've stopped receiving push notifications this last week. Anyone else having this problem? 
org.wordpress.android#103552:	   Can't login in my self host wordpress.. 
org.wordpress.android#103557:	   Please fix. 
org.wordpress.android#103563:	   The only problem is when you publish a blog on your mobile device then attempt to open it on your computer, all paragraphs are deleted. Apart from that, helpful and easy to use! 
org.wordpress.android#103573:	   Can't get my import files to upload to wordpress 
org.wordpress.android#103584:	   I am facing problems while uploading media directly on my blog, please make it right ASAP. 
org.wordpress.android#103594:	   When i try to post blog only test uploaded but no one media like audio; video ;images cannot uploading 
org.wordpress.android#103598:	   If i try adding self hosted site on the WP app. It takes me back to the login page, and it wont login in... How do i fix that? 
org.wordpress.android#103599:	   Does not work with WordPress installs on your own host even though it's the same software. 
org.wordpress.android#103607:	   Completely USELESS WILL NOT LET ME POST A Y THING MADE. EARLY 3 ACCO U NHS TRY ING TO FIX THE ISSUE WONT LET ME POST A NOTHING KEEP SAYING VERIFY EMAIL WHICH MUST OF BEEN DONE 30 TIME ALMOST! HAVE NOT REVIVED ANYTHING! !!!!!!; 
org.wordpress.android#103611:	   This app won't display my site. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling and still didn't work. 
org.wordpress.android#103613:	   Every time I login to WordPress, WordPress immediately logs me back out. My password and username are correct so... I am not understanding the problem, please fix this. 
org.wordpress.android#103614:	   I cannot login. My password and username are both correct. I hit reset password and put in my email and it says email not registered. Wtf. Fix it. 
org.wordpress.android#103626:	   Now i see why people can't long in, it doesn't work for me either. It always say we can't log you in 
org.wordpress.android#103627:	   Cannot load photos from the app. If I do get lucky and get a photo on, when I hit upload it just sits there 'uploading' and I have to restart my tablet. Sometimes I can't even type on a post. Looking into other blogging services. 
org.wordpress.android#103630:	   It's say "you can't login" without any reason. I'm sure my e-mail and password is correct. Please fix it. 
org.wordpress.android#103631:	   I have never had a problem using this app 
org.wordpress.android#103636:	   Could be good but its useless due to the problem with establishing connection. I have to reload 10 times for my post list update. Its the same with pages, stats, publishing a post, even with login. I tested this on many wifis, with data on, on different devices, ... Same problem everywhere. Fix it and ill give you 4 stars. UPDATE: if i could id rate this app -5. Its pure crap. I was writing a long post, but this app only (due to its problems with connection) only saved the first paragraph. Uninstalled. 
org.wordpress.android#103642:	   Where are You owner when I maped domain my site is not working now PLEASE HELP ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
org.wordpress.android#103650:	   Problem slow 
org.wordpress.android#103664:	   Will not upload pictures saved to my device, only from memory card. Is now not posting any posts, just saving them as drafts. Thanks for effing up my blog wordpress, will now be looking for another host 
org.wordpress.android#103675:	   I like word press but I have issues downloading free backgrounds. .also getting to my writings for editorial purposes is a challenge. It gets stuck a great deal of the time when I have finished writing a piece...the starving artist 
org.wordpress.android#103679:	   The app is so much slow. Trying to change my profile pic since last an hour but NOTHING. The app is of no use. 
org.wordpress.android#103681:	   I can never edit my post on the first try. There will ALWAYS be an error and wants me to refresh. Even when I have refreshed, I still can't edit my post. Until when the app feels like it then can i edit my post. And the app feels just like a blown up version of the phone one. 
org.wordpress.android#103684:	   Does not work if you have a custom admin panel URL (anything other than /wp-admin/) and there is no setting that takes care of this. Thus, the app is useless for those of us who care about their blog's basic security. 
org.wordpress.android#103686:	   Please don't make me hate it! First impression it's good, but so far so bad.. Application says media server error, okay! but why losting my wrote?!!... DAMN!!!... its not once, but it's already for third time!.. oooh man!! 
org.wordpress.android#103693:	   I thought this app would come in handy but it was very slow and annoying. It takes tomorrow to load! And it is not mobile friendly, it's hard to read and see blogs. It's a complicated app and very irritating. Fix this guys. But for now, UNINSTALLING... 
org.wordpress.android#103696:	  I can't post comments anymore and I it crashes rapidly. 
org.wordpress.android#103704:	   This works great on my android phone, I haven't had any problems with it I hope I continue not to. 
org.wordpress.android#103705:	   Had a few issues lately after using for a couple years but turns out it was my hosting company causing the problems. Changed hosts and its back to perfect. Was also getting media errors when trying to upload so well see if that goes away now too. 
org.wordpress.android#103709:	   Not good 1. Don't have a engine search for post by name or month 2. Show text and page code together when I try to edit old post 3. I can't upload pictures from app for a page that I get permission to do it 4. Can't access same options that I get from WordPress page 
org.wordpress.android#103710:	  Same profile upload issue as mentioned here already, which actually has stopped me proceeding any further. 
org.wordpress.android#103713:	   For android app, wordpress is a good experience, but I am having trouble in uploading profile pic. As gallery is not showing up to choose any image from. Please do something with this bug asap. 
org.wordpress.android#103716:	   I've been using this app,but now I can't even post again because it won't upload 3 pictures of a combined size of 156kb. Soo pissed! 
org.wordpress.android#103720:	   I have had this app for 2 years. Over the past couple of updates, the app will not save post drafts. I will not save changes and it always says error for uploading post. This sucks. This goes on with my samsung tablet and my lg android phone. 
org.wordpress.android#103721:	   One of the major attractions this app has for me is the ability to write offline posts. However, two bugs make it completely unusable for that purpose. First of all, adding images offline and then reopening the post with an active internet connection removes all the images. Second, if the internet connection fails during a post upload (eg one with 30 images), the whole upload hangs, the app has to be force closed and then the upload restarted from scratch... This has litteraly cost me hours of my time. 
org.wordpress.android#103723:	   Can't see anything on the page where you type your blog on the app, with the keypad obscuring everything even when I'm not typing. Today (which was also only the second time), when I posted on my blog, WP wouldn't let me reposition images inside the article after adding descriptions to them, both on the app and the website and I had to add an additional note at the beginning of my article explaining the images, compromising its structure. I'm new to WP and intend to write more, so please fix these asap. 
org.wordpress.android#103743:	  I can't login. I just registered. Again, I can upload media files. Please help fix it. Thanks 
org.wordpress.android#103746:	   Unknown error is occuring while signing in ,can't connect with it . 
org.wordpress.android#103752:	   This was working fine until I updated it a day or two ago. Now the picture resizing is not working, image captions don't appear, and in the editor the cursor appears several spaces in front of where it actually acts. It's completely unusable like this, please help me to revert to the previous version! 
org.wordpress.android#103756:	   Wordpress is something I have to use in my major for college, and I have never had a problem with it. 
org.wordpress.android#103765:	   Would love to use the app when it is fixed. 
org.wordpress.android#103767:	  Guys....no affect of the new update....same stability issue with my phone...please do find what is the issue for Huawei G7.....I want to use the app but is f.... crashing my phone...... 
org.wordpress.android#103771:	   Once I got used to how it stores locally before drafting to the web, I found that method worked best. Recently blogged a 7 day trip without issue. 
org.wordpress.android#103772:	   I can not login to my hosted wordpress to even try to use app so 1 star... 
org.wordpress.android#103773:	  Account setup crashes 
org.wordpress.android#103779:	   I've been travelling and thought this would be an ideal tool to blog off line as I travelled. Don't try it. I lost hours of work as any attempt to add to or edit your very first drafts results in large chunks of text being lost. Developers eventually admitted it was a bug but aren't bothered enough to fix it before the next major version. 
org.wordpress.android#103780:	   Crashes regularly when adding photos by gallery within a post 
org.wordpress.android#103788:	   Even I cant edit my blog. not user friendly 
org.wordpress.android#103798:	  This is a great app, but the latest update 4.3 messed up. Notifications, werent updating, reblog and like buttons were gone, and the contact function didnt work so couldnt even report the issues. Left a message here which seems to have disappeared, butsince then have read about the 4.3.1 update, and IT SOLVES ALL THE ISSUES! Immediately! So give it a try. I wish Automattic would have sent out the update automatically (pardon the pun!) to save us all this grief. 
org.wordpress.android#103803:	   Very mast aaps per seting me problem 
org.wordpress.android#103805:	   Since a new update the option to reblog a post from another blog I follow is not available. Or am I missing something. I use a Note 4 . How do I reblog it's driving me mad . Since I last updated the app I can no longer add pics or compose and send a post without getting an upload error message. It really ia not good enough. I run a successful blog but am finding it harder and harder to do . Please fix this issue. Others have mentioned it so please reply. 
org.wordpress.android#103815:	   Doesn't seem to support any standard styles (h1, h2, blockquote, etc). Therefore, cannot write a post start to finish - always have to go back and edit from a browser before publishing even a simple article. Fail. 
org.wordpress.android#103821:	   Cant login on Samsung galaxy s4 with latest update but it's work on my acer lz160 with older version. Please fix it. --edited-- fixed in latest update. Thanks! 
org.wordpress.android#103823:	  I can't login to my blog through the app. The "contact us" option throws an error. Why did this make it through QA? Super fast update resolved it. Kudos! 
org.wordpress.android#103824:	   The new update works great and more handy to use! I use this app to monitor my sites stats and to publish new post occasionally. Even though i had login issue with the previous update, hats off to developer the problem is now solved!! Thanks!! 
org.wordpress.android#103826:	  Plz fix it i cant even download it :/ 
org.wordpress.android#103831:	   If there is one I can't find it. While using the app on samsung galaxy note 3, a botched copy and paste attempt resulted in an entire post disappearing. Very infuriating!! Will never write a draft in this app again. Will write it elsewhere then transfer in. Plus it won't upload my video. Says I need to update video press. Even after I updated the wordpress app. Why isn't everything included in one app.? Update: July 22 2015 just installed an update and now I can't see recent comments on the app feed. 
org.wordpress.android#103833:	    like all the comments here. Please fix it 
org.wordpress.android#103835:	   I can't login with this apps, very disappointed 
org.wordpress.android#103836:	   Seriously. Can't you guys get anything right? Just one screw up after another. No one can log in on the app. Fix this ASAP! 
org.wordpress.android#103837:	   I can't log in my blog after I update the latest version!! Please fix soon!!! I must create my blog!! I can log in website but can't on my phone!! Why??? Fix ITT!! Many people are regret!! 
org.wordpress.android#103839:	  I can't login 
org.wordpress.android#103840:	  Can't login after downloading this app 
org.wordpress.android#103843:	   New update won't let me log in and then won't let me contact WP about the issue... 
org.wordpress.android#103844:	  Cannot login 
org.wordpress.android#103845:	   Don't know why a big blogger company like WP, creating such a damn s**** app. Just recently install it today but can't even use it nor logged in. Here's the app bug logs : WordPress Android version: 4.3 Android device name: Xiaomi HM 1SW 01 - resetting suggestion tables 02 - trackLastActivity, activityId: My Site 03 - Number of old stats deleted : 0 04 - NewAccountAbstractOage.onCreate() 05 - trackLastActivity, activityId: Login Screen 06 - GCM Error: INVALID_SENDER 07 - Server response: 08 - NewAccountAbs 
org.wordpress.android#103846:	   I don't think I'm the only one having this issue, please fix it as fast as you can cause friends and I are using these for our art project. 
org.wordpress.android#103848:	   Read the review abt not being able to log in. Decided to try my luck and now decided to uninstall... guess the bug smashing release got smashed by the bugs... 
org.wordpress.android#103850:	   It's not logging me in on my Xiaomi Mi 4 device. I tried uninstalling and installing it back but still doesn't work. Please fix! 
org.wordpress.android#103851:	   I love the site but hate this app because I can't log in to the app even though i changed my password because i thought that was the problem but isn't. 
org.wordpress.android#103852:	   It wont upload the pages i create. It also wont upload changes i make via this app which is frustrating!! Please fix as i have to keep going onto the computer to do what i need to via the website. 
org.wordpress.android#103855:	   I can't login my account in the mobile app but I can login in the website. So whats the use of this app. 
org.wordpress.android#103858:	   But today its not letting me login to my new blog i just created through the app. I can only login through the site. This needs fixed asap 
org.wordpress.android#103859:	   Update to rating, After getting help from customer support, they were able to get me into my account was very fast with the response even after several attempts to get in, until they worked out the problem. Now it's not an issue. . . . Tried many times to log in, and I know the email and pass are correct, however it says they aren't correct! So disappointing. 
org.wordpress.android#103860:	   Tbh the app looks great ... Alot of options , nice UI ... But the problem is , " I can't upload any posts to my wordpress site with this app " .... Gosh !!!! U guys kidding me ? When I try to post something it shows "Uploading " for around 50 seconds and after that it always shows. " post upload failed : An error occured while uploading the post " Even if the post contain just a heading and 3 lines of content ( no media files ) the result is same. For gods sake , plz fix this bug ASAP. 
org.wordpress.android#103867:	   Every time I schedule a post it publishes it that minute anyway. I love the app but that bugs me so much fix please!! 
org.wordpress.android#103875:	   The app is amazing but the latest update has made it really tough to publish a post, I have even faced deletion of a few of my writings. Please see to your application and the problems. 
org.wordpress.android#103876:	  I've had to re-write and upload my pictures three times after publishing a post. Please sort this issue out because it's time consuming and very unpleasant to deal with 
org.wordpress.android#103880:	   I just can't login my account.. N my WordPress site works very vell with my pc 
org.wordpress.android#103886:	   Shows only 2 out of my posts! Where are all others? Then, trying to open a post, another error. Won't open the site at all with stupid security message. Totally unusable now. Not even 5%. Not even viewing postes. Why put a non working app on google play? Why misleading the users? 
org.wordpress.android#103893:	   Worst app I have ever tried to use. It will not even let me upload, all I get is an error message that I was not authorized to do that. I was able to upload to the site without the app so why not with the app. Would love to know. 
org.wordpress.android#103899:	   The app has gone worse. Why did you do this? :( Regretting updating it. It just closes down between the function. Also, I can't update and reschedule my posts. Nothing! Fix it please....asap 
org.wordpress.android#103923:	   I wish that I could give this negative 100 stars. I hate the set up I hate you have to go through so much to get your drafts or posts synced to the desktop and I literally hate this app because my local draft just erased and now I can't get it back. 
org.wordpress.android#103927:	   Couldn't access my site. As useful as a chocolate fireguard 
org.wordpress.android#103929:	   I rely on this app to communicate. Wordpress itself is great, but the app will delete an entire post, losing me hours of time and energy, if I back out or answer a call while the post is loading. It appears to do no cached versions, so everything is lost. It doesn't even do a "you just said to save a blank post instead of the 1000 word 12 photo one you had, is that on purpose?" I do save every once in a while, but it doesnt matter with this issue, it saves over. Back up your stuff on another app. 
org.wordpress.android#103935:	   Spent an hour writing a blog. I attached 1 small video and 7 pictures. Clicked upload and 5sec later phone was sluggish and unresponsive. An hour later on ultra high-speed Korean 4g LTE+, the phone was still unresponsive and the app still said uploading. Had to restart phone. Went back to app, clicked local copy then edit. Blog was there for 3sec then went blank. Had to rewrite. Same issue again when I tried to post. 5hrs and 3 rewrites later, blog was still not uploaded. Worst app I've ever delt with. 
org.wordpress.android#103939:	   Not particularly impressed with the new update. Its so tight. Too much going on all in one space. And I can't upload pictures anymore........ Not liking it 
org.wordpress.android#103959:	   Please fix this. 
org.wordpress.android#103961:	   I am having troubles uploading blog posts, often after it uploads everything it says error and in fact uploads nothing. Also deleted my whole post - twice. Scared to use it without backing up elsewhere anymore. 
org.wordpress.android#103964:	  While everything else seems fine and functional with the newest version I've noticed that it shows my blog as having about 2099 posts while I have over 2200. The comment counter is also far off and the categories. It would be great to see this aligned properly for reference. UPDATE: It's been over a year and some revisions that I pointed this out and its still not a rectified issue. Now the blog has over 3100 posts and yet the app shows 3060. Otherwise I really like this app as its quite helpful. 
org.wordpress.android#103967:	   Its not work multi select photo, pls help 
org.wordpress.android#103981:	   Wouldn't work on my note 
org.wordpress.android#103991:	   Simply deletes your stuff and doesn't sync with server. Truly rubbish!!!!! 
org.wordpress.android#103993:	   Problems in uploading photos. 
org.wordpress.android#104003:	  Cannot add an image and now I m having a problem to view it in web 
org.wordpress.android#104014:	  Uploading images or media fails 
org.wordpress.android#104018:	   I can't find  
org.wordpress.android#104019:	   I don't know what happened. Just noticed today that it's been infected with a virus. I uninstalled then installed again, still the same issue. I had to uninstall this. Let me know what to do cos I love using this app. Thanks. 
org.wordpress.android#104021:	   Latest version does not function correctly. Using self hosted blog and I cannot browse media library. Other small problems as well. 
org.wordpress.android#104039:	   Was a great app but now it crashes my whole phone. I just don't post from my phone, too much of a hassle. 
org.wordpress.android#104045:	   Posted a post.. On blog it's showing 404 error and the image was also missing from the blog..! 
org.wordpress.android#104046:	   Sometimes when publishing my content is not uploaded and drafts are deleted. This very frustrating. 
org.wordpress.android#104048:	   Its is not downloding it is showing error has come 
org.wordpress.android#104051:	   The new update. Now I can't upload my photos. . It took me 8 hours to get 4 of five photos to upload. I had to change it to gallery etc. It's a mess. I just did a factory reset on my phone. It happened before and after I rest..... I can't find the link on the website for tech support so lame. The app was perfect before. I'm visually impaired. I could see it better. Light Blue and white is a graphic design nightmare. And it's harder for me to see the new app type (accessibility). 
org.wordpress.android#104054:	  When I select view site or admin it goes to a 503 error 
org.wordpress.android#104086:	  App Sucks, Always "Error Occurring" 
org.wordpress.android#104091:	   Im using android lolipop 5.02 and this aplication is not working on my smartphone 
org.wordpress.android#104092:	  NOT 5 stars on this release. It doesn't remove spam comments from list (self-hosted site). Otherwise love this app. 
org.wordpress.android#104094:	  Didn't work at all for self-hosted site 
org.wordpress.android#104098:	   Since update the photos won't stay put. One star because I spent way too much time. And I have to wait to fix it 
org.wordpress.android#104100:	   While trying to add a new post and inserting a url using the copy and paste feature on my htc 616 ..it force closes automatically and is not letting me add a url..the insert link feature didn't work either. 
org.wordpress.android#104103:	  Not able to get to my blog posts. Error occurring. Like the side bar layout more too. 
org.wordpress.android#104123:	   Continuously kicks out Media Upload errors, messes up formatting with posts and images, and sometimes dumps entire posts when you're trying to upload.  with this. I'm so upset right now. I'd gladly pay for something that worked!! 
org.wordpress.android#104129:	  Can only view list of posts for single blog, can't get to comments or change blog. Am on Samsung Note 2, and rely on this app when away from home. Please fix. Comment below has resolved my issue (I removed app shortcut and replaced, and now opens at control panel.) 
org.wordpress.android#104132:	   Won't let me see anything but my posts. I can't access blogs I follow or stats now. Also I hate that when I open the app it goes to my posts. I would like it to go to the reader like it was when I first started WordPress. 
org.wordpress.android#104133:	   The latest update was a total fail! Now I can't access anything at all! Can only view my own posts! Please fix this asap! 
org.wordpress.android#104134:	   Did you guys mean to introduce a serious bug? Testes testes ...1...2...balls! You might have solved some people's issue with back button exiting app but that introduced a bigger issue: one can't access anything other than posts. Fix it quick. 
org.wordpress.android#104141:	   Each time I download, I get the error message saying the package was not signed correctly. 
org.wordpress.android#104148:	   The app works brilliantly for MY blog but when I search the internet (outside the app) and find a Wordpress blog I want to open I don't get the option to open the blog in the app unfortunately. 
org.wordpress.android#104150:	   Quite possibly one of the worst apps out there. Simply doesn't work. Connected my account but absolutely nothing else about it works. Doesn't refresh, can't post new stuff, can't edit existing stuff. No response from support. Expected better from Automattic. Uninstalled. 
org.wordpress.android#104157:	   How to fix? 
org.wordpress.android#104161:	   Every time I am uploading some media majority pictures. . It says error occurred while uploading media. .Do something plzz. . 
org.wordpress.android#104171:	   Can't upload photos. I hope you can fix this. But on the brighter side, the app is great  
org.wordpress.android#104172:	   Continuously get errors when trying to approve comments on posts. 
org.wordpress.android#104174:	   Data review is broken, permanent 503 server error when viewing site too, log in doesn't work unless app is force closed and restarted then your magically logged in, or your logged in but in the app your logged out and nothing updates which means a complete reinstall is necessary as no other workaround has fixed that issue. Uninstalling, if I could give negative stars I would. 
org.wordpress.android#104178:	   I use the mobile app on the road to update my travel blog, and post picture galleries. But I can not upload cover pics anymore for them. I don't know whether it's a phone issue or an app issue. Please look into it. Would rate 5 otherwise. Thx. 
org.wordpress.android#104183:	   The find friends and discover options don't work and I can't choose a file from my phone for the Gravatar. 
org.wordpress.android#104204:	   The app will not work on my site. I have a self-signed SSL certificate (nobody else logs onto my server and needs to verify its identity). If I try to log in, a warning pops up. When I tap Yes to log in anyway, I am returned to the log in screen. 
org.wordpress.android#104206:	   Always turning off tried to post 3 times each time I had to retype 400 plus words!!! Trying add a picture 4 times now and it says its stopped working . this many problems within 1 hour of having the app..... I'll pass!!!!!!! 
org.wordpress.android#104208:	   You cannot work properly.. but,it's good 
org.wordpress.android#104209:	   "An error occurred while uploading media files" Fix this and get 5 stars 
org.wordpress.android#104227:	   This app have not working in mobile and cant access gallery for upload files 
org.wordpress.android#104230:	   Can't login to selfhosted site 
org.wordpress.android#104233:	   I can't upload my posts even after several attempts. 
org.wordpress.android#104242:	   Great for quick posts and editing of your blog. Except did not save drafts that WordPress always saved before had ap. 
org.wordpress.android#104244:	   This is great for them blogging moments whilst travelling or to schedule posts on the go. However it does sometimes remove photos upon save and lately has been deleting content of full blog posts, giving me an error when I upload. Had to reinstall. 
org.wordpress.android#104253:	   I can post pictures if I'm not using the new media picker. That option still crashes the app. 
org.wordpress.android#104261:	   The problem described below has been fixed (at least on my device). Thanks guys! - Several days ago, the app started freezing the entire device every time you tap the "Add image" button. Only solution is restarting the tablet (power button, press & hold). The tablet is a Lenovo B8080-H running stock Android 4.3. Also tried rebuilding the media library, but to no effect. Other than that, I'd give the app four stars. 
org.wordpress.android#104263:	   Big issue is you can only upload one photo at a time to a post : ( 
org.wordpress.android#104265:	   I don't know how to exit, "back" key isn't working 
org.wordpress.android#104270:	   I'm one of those for whom the app still does'nt work. I have to re-enter the username and password for my blog or admin everytime I rotate my phone, and thats annoying. I'm using Samsung Galaxy S5 (SM-G900H) Please fix !!! 
org.wordpress.android#104284:	   I can post with image, it takes me long time and error results 
org.wordpress.android#104285:	   I have had a problem for the last 2 days where I can't refresh my posts, therefore I cant see my posts. Please look into it 
org.wordpress.android#104289:	   Now it just gives me the following "An error has occurred when uploading media' when fixed, will upgrade to 5 stars 
org.wordpress.android#104291:	   Trying to add an image to a post is impossible. I click in the icon to uploade an image from either the device or site, and the uploader just keeps rotating every few seconds, it's ridiculous. Can't get it to do anything. I just sit here watching it rotate 45 degrees over and over and over again till I close the app. 
org.wordpress.android#104295:	   This app does not work. Screens mash with each other. Refresh won't solve issue. Display pic cannot be uploaded. Extremely slow app. 
org.wordpress.android#104296:	   In general I was very happy with the app. Never caused problems and was fun to use. Recently (probably after upgrade) uploading photos became an issue, but for me the worst is that after two hours of writing a post offline I got online and instead of uploading, the app just deleted everything!!! 
org.wordpress.android#104304:	   This glitch has been persistent from a long time now. It's annoying. Please resolve the issue. I'm unable to follow most any blogs! 
org.wordpress.android#104314:	  Needs fixing. App does not connect to website. Needs update . WordPress on pc is version 4.2 
org.wordpress.android#104318:	   As other reviewers have said, the app freezes up whenever I try to insert an image. I have a Samsung Note 10.1 and every attempt has locked my tablet. I attempted an uninstall/reinstall and the same problem occurs. The window also begins cutting off longer posts. The post is still there, but you will need to use your up/down buttons instead of the scroll function to see it. There is also no menu once you get to the post screen. Navigation between dashboard, post, and post options is difficult. I have been frustrated by the last several updates to this app. If you need to only post text, it isn't so bad, hence two stars. Any posts beyond simple, short text should be done online. 
org.wordpress.android#104320:	   Unless the intention of the developer was to force people to be super minimalistic on their blog posts then the FC issues are a big pain! Please get this fixed. Rooted Galaxy S3 with L. 
org.wordpress.android#104321:	   Just joined... terrible app. Uploads take forever and image always fails! This is just about the worst app I've ever tried. Don't they test these things first??? 
org.wordpress.android#104323:	   As much as I would have loved rating wordpress 5stars, the image wouldn't let me do that. Please help fix it as soon as possible. Havent been able to use it anymore effectively since I last updated it. Thanks 
org.wordpress.android#104325:	   I use Wordpress as the site for my business and have always been happy with it, but the latest update is absolute garbage. It now won't let me upload images from my tablet directly to my posts, and if I try it crashes my device and I have to force close my other programmes and have to restart it. This has a big effect on my online work. Dreadful. 
org.wordpress.android#104337:	   Ever since ive download it. It doesnt load commets posts just keeps showing loading errors. Hated it. This app is trash never works. 
org.wordpress.android#104340:	   I really love using WordPress for my blog, but it's frustrating using the app to try and upload any images into a blog post. My tablet freezes completely when trying to add an image,resulting in me having to restart it every time and not getting anywhere so I end up doing it on my desktop. The thought was to be able to post while I'm away from my computer but it's failing. 
org.wordpress.android#104345:	   Since I updated the app, I can't upload image to my post, my phone keeps hanging. Please do something. ASAP 
org.wordpress.android#104349:	   I'm using a Samsung note 3. It won't allow me to select any images to upload. And thought the app it's messed up with text appearing over the top of other text and really just doesn't work well. Especially hard if you have two blog pages. Very difficult to switch between them. 
org.wordpress.android#104350:	   been trying to install but i cant. gives me error code "-24" 
org.wordpress.android#104356:	   5/1/2015 -- I have another problem in attaching images. Now, I'm using Galaxy Tab S 10.5. Everytime I try to attach an image, the app would act up.... ==== I always have a problem posting pics using Samsung Galaxy Note. Either the pics would not be posted or the format is destroyed. I always have to fix an article in my laptop or iPad. 
org.wordpress.android#104357:	   I spent an agonising hour with my tablet frozen from trying to upload a photo into my post. Quick and easy... more like terrifying wait, hoping my most important couldnt be rewritten post didnt disapear. Luckily it had saved and I swiftly published it then logged on my laptop and edited to add the picture... please fix. 
org.wordpress.android#104358:	   Htlm is not working, image not showing in post, only codes 
org.wordpress.android#104363:	   but shear horror if you want to upload images.Upload is interrupted most of the time leaves the local media cache completely broken.No easy upload of multiple images (workaround via filemanager share dialog), no progress bar on upload (no idea if finished, incomplete or still working).Crashes if accidentally refresh media library during upload. Please devs, add a decent way to upload images with progress info and feedback if it was successful or failed. Otherwise it's a real pain in the ass to use the app. 
org.wordpress.android#104364:	   I blog daily and I have been trying to improve my insights by adding my personal touch of my life and I tried adding some great diy photos and it keeps shutting my phone off and not publishing like its suppose to. I don't understand what the problem is..please fix the glitch..its honestly annoying and its affecting my insights for readers and potential fans. 
org.wordpress.android#104370:	  Crashing all the time. Plus its very slow. Also improve the UI of mobile site 
org.wordpress.android#104371:	   Just when I was getting used to how bad this app was they made it worse causing me to lose full posts and now I can't upload photos from Dropbox... Ruined it 
org.wordpress.android#104372:	   Update: the small issue I was having was resolved promptly. I am a big fan of this very good app. My original review was: "The latest update is not helpful; my password doesn't save on my phone (HTC one m8), so every time I go to the app, I have to log in again. Not a big deal for you, maybe, but having the brain injury I do makes this issue inconvenient enough to consider moving my blog to a different service altogether. Please fix this!" 
org.wordpress.android#104373:	   . I like the feature to access my local wordpress. Nice. But there is something, I can not access my product from woocommerce plugin. Maybe that's another system. Thanks by the way for making this app. 
org.wordpress.android#104374:	   Reported an bug within the app and they contacted me and fixed the error quickly. 
org.wordpress.android#104376:	  Much better with the glitch fixed cheers. 
org.wordpress.android#104377:	   I had a huge blog post that I had almost uploaded then it gives me an error and now the whole post is gone are you freaking kidding me? So sick of this app 
org.wordpress.android#104380:	   Since the last update I can't use my regular photo viewer to choose pictures from my post. I now have a list of images that seem to come from my tablet but not it's sd card; where all my images are. I have around 30,000 images in various picture folders (I am travelling and have a 128GB sd card in my tablet where my images are stored) and this update to 3.9 has made choosing images impossible. I have two possible workarounds. Either I upload the images to google or similar and put a link in the post to them. Or my second option is to upload the images in the WordPress app through the media menu item and then choose these images I want in the post using your new chooser interface. Honestly I see what you are trying to do with the new interface but it does limit the user as to how they choose their images. Handing this task over to the operating system, as it was before, makes more sense and makes your app lighter. Please switch back to the normal way of adding images. Updating posts on tablets and phones has been great with the WordPress app and I feel it's just been made more difficult with this update. 
org.wordpress.android#104387:	   I'm new to blog. but I can't sit in front of computer and do all blogging all the time. that's why I'm installing this. But between Wp mobile and site  so well. I lost my drafted post because the site save the previous work. so I have to rewrite my post on site once again. what a waste! and another things please make the wp mobile menus exactly like the desktop menu. Such as caption of images should be centered, right? But there is no such option on wp mobile. Pls fix. TY 
org.wordpress.android#104391:	   An Ok app but it has it's limits. I often have to transfer to a computer because the app is so hard to use, or I can't find something 
org.wordpress.android#104392:	   Suddenly I can't upload pictures to my HTC1 (8). What's happening? It was working fine. 
org.wordpress.android#104394:	   This app does not work on my Samsung tablet. Tried adding photos to post but brought my tablet to a grinding hault. Not recommended. 
org.wordpress.android#104395:	   Wordpress should stop fixing things that aren't broken. They went from the absolute finest blog platform to a sputtering, smoking wreck at the rear of the pack. Simply attempting to insert an image into a post now completely locks up my tablet. Stop fixing things. Now I have to find a new blog platform. Bring back 3.8. 
org.wordpress.android#104407:	   Every time I try to add a photo to my post it hangs my tablet, making the screen completely unresponsive and randomly changes the screen orientation even though tablet hasn't moved. Only option is to reboot, losing all work. Please fix! UPDATE: I uninstalled this version (3.9) and installed the one from the Amazon Appstore (3.8) I can now add images and find photos again. Not updating until I know everything is fixed!
