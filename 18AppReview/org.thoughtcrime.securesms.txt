org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30006:	  Can't use it with pushbullet. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30019:	  Nice UI and easy to use. I get some errors every once in a while for connectivity issues. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30021:	  Not registering mobile number long time And then sending sms not free 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30027:	  Awesome app. Small problem with notifications since I upgraded to nougat but no issues otherwise 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30032:	  Problem with the notifications, the app does not notify about new message despite as settings turned on. Otherwise fine 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30034:	  No quick send message takes time to deliver." Call problem, takes time in dialing then ringing. You don't care of suggestions and reply. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30040:	  I've not had a problem at all with it so far. I'm a bit of a privacy nut so it's good to see an app that's secure between Signal users. Long may it continue. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30065:	  This app could be great but needs a lot of work. I've been using this app for about 6 months, and it has some very annoying issues. It only notifys me of new messages when it feels like it. I'll go hours without responding to someone because it never sent me a notification. Also, everytime I install this, either because I got a new phone or reimaged my phone, it completely butchers my contacts. Some of them go missing, most of them are then duplicated. It's very frustrating. So, save yourself the trouble and don't use this until they do some major fixes. Also worth noting, Voxer now offers secure/private voice and text messaging without all of the annoying bugs. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30068:	  I kept texting my friends and they weren't texting back....then I figured out it was signal. Everyone kept telling me in person that they were texting me back. Signal was and is blocking certain texts from coming through. I don't get it...honestly. This app is a piece...don't DOWNLOAD it. Save yourself the trouble and stick with the stock messaging app. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30080:	  Very good integration for both needs. Friends don't have signal would send out as regular messages. One thing though, once secured messages established, and your friend is out of data area, the secured message would not be sent as regular, it would be pending till your friend gets either data or wifi. You would know as message is failed on your end, but your friend would not. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30089:	  A little problem with notification sound. But over all an awsome app 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30094:	  Unknown contacts can't be blocked. One of the reasons why I deleted WhatsApp was that random people started to say hi. Thought Signal was much better. Please fix this. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30099:	  I Love the app! But please improve the call function! The call quality is acceptable but not very good. And the media sending doesn't always work without problems. Bedside that awsome job ! I'm spreading it! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30100:	  Works great except it doesn't work with my cars bluetooth dashboard phone integration making it difficult to be a complete Android Message SMS replacement. Android Message works fine with my car displaying incoming messages and allowing me to select one-button replies like, call me i'm driving, etc. Signal's texts don't appear and there is no apparent integration. Not sure why there would be a difference. I have a 2014 Chevy Cruze. My phone is running Marshmallow. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30105:	  Mostly, Signal is excellent. I have given it 4 stars as sending MMS to non Signal users is still not working quite right, but with that said, I would still highly recommend. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30113:	  Awesome app, even sorted network issue with SMS 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30121:	  Use this for texting and messaging. [Don't use anything else] 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30128:	  It's pretty damn good. I like the mini-messenger drop-down for a quick reply. However, group texts and, more often than not, pictures/video can't be recieved (and sometimes sent). It tries to pull in group SMS as a single-person MMS and fails. The other two just don't pull in. This is rarely reported on GitHub, and nobody has fixed it yet. Strangely enough, after an update, it works for a solid 5 minutes before failing again. Other than that, great app! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30129:	  Truly encrypted messaging that syncs across mobile and desktop. It's fast and responsive. My only issue is that sometimes mobile messages don't sync to a desktop that was offline when the messages were sent, but it usually catches up. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30157:	  Good app, occasional encryption errors but overall works well 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30171:	  Pretty good. Only problem is linking desktop to it and it replays the message queue as it deletes it. So a clever person could record the screen. Needs fixing that. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30190:	  Clean design. App is very responsive and straightforward to use. Easily replaces other SMS apps without effort. Call quality is good. Unfortunately I can no longer send SMS to any non-signal user. My phone warns me the app is sending a large amount of SMS, but the warning immediately reappears upon pressing accept. I will re-rate when this issue is fixed. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30193:	  I finally switched to signal when WhatsApp decided to be stupid with its latest update. My one issue though is that my friends with iPhones can't send voicenotes. Fix that and this will be a 5-star app. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30200:	  Why my call and video call is not working ?????? 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30212:	   Can't install the app in android gingerbread 2.3.6 version ,getting error essage that can't install the app (error :11) plz fix the issue soon 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30216:	  This is the best messanging app I've ever downloaded, no ads no failures. Big up to the developer!! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30222:	  Not getting new message notifications. Which is basic requirement of a messaging app. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30239:	  The app is lovely for the most part. The only thing I seem to have trouble with is sending pictures through mms. The whole app has to be restarted before sending anymore texts. Just a minor annoyance for an otherwise solid app. Edit: the messages not sending now can't be fixed by just restarting the app. This is absolutely not working at all for me. switched back to regular messaging app until i can find one that does not fail to send texts. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30243:	  Easy to switch. Convenient reply pop out. Had some issues with MMS when on WiFi but their forums helped new fix it. Overall my favorite messaging app to date. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30247:	  Lat update sucks!!! I have been using signal for a good while now and loved it...and all of the sudden delays in messaging please fix it or good bye signal 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30254:	  5 stars if you can make it look as nice as Chomp. Issue: wife sent me message on hangouts because signal stopped working. Now all our texts are reversed on her display. My text are as if they're from her and vice versa. On MY screen, my last text I sent is shown as if SHE sent it to ME. Other than that, mine works fine. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30258:	  Needs alternative method to link devices, for when the default camera does not work 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30265:	  i really wanted to like this app. the customizability is great. security also. unfortunately, it sometimes randomly decides to send one message a dozen times in the space of a few seconds, blowing up your friends' phones with one message repeated 18 times. it's done this to me 3 times. only fix was to delete and reinstall. I'm done; this problem is worse than Samsung Messenger's issues. ETA: that was last year; it appears to not do that anymore. However, the timestamp is irritatingly imprecise, saying "ten mintes ago" (and often remaining inaccurate for hours) instead of the actual time. what is this, Facebook? it's a terrible design. also, the new giant "one unread message" WHILE YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE MESSAGE is one of the most annoying "features" I've ever seen. please make it possible to turn this off! it's in the way, inaccurate, and unnecessary. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30266:	  Thanks for getting back to me. The issue was fixed due to the way the phone number was formatted. My one question, is this really private so no one can access my messages....Google, NSA, ect ? 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30268:	  MMS on Project Fi; looking forward to a fix 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30269:	  Really wanted to use this. But it has a known, persistent bug that blocks downloading MMS and pics while on wifi on some phones. Tried all fixes from website and GitHub. Good app if it works for your device. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30289:	  App fails to notify non delivery of messages to users that have deinstalled Signal. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30299:	  Works as described, I haven't had any problems with the app. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30303:	  Does as described, however I am also experiencing lengthy delays between 2 devices using signal exchanging messages and calls, contacts using standard messengers are getting through in normal time. I understand minor delay, but 2 hours between messages make this not useful 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30306:	  This app is great between signal users. Standard SMS functionality is good too. Have not used the voice much but seems to work decently well. Sending MMS to non signal users I experience done delay but nothing unmanageable. Just need to get all my contacts using signal haha 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30310:	  Currently having issues with sending and receiving media. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30316:	  The app worked fine before the update, now I can't send pictures. I'll give 5 stars when the problem is fixed 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30321:	  It's simple to setup very quick. I wish it didn't use iOS emojis though, and the setting to disable them also disables my enter key making it like Google hangouts, which isn't what I want. Also, TunnelBear VPN will interfere with sending messages. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30322:	  Good app for texting but frequently fails at sending photos. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30340:	  It does not seem to be a common problem, but I struggle to send and receive messages reliably. Sometimes they get lost along the way, sometimes I get notified with great delays. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30349:	  I can't send/receive picture messages. Always an error when sending and never downloads when receiving 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30361:	  Keyboard is all screwed up & other ppl I've talked to have the same problem, I hafta hit letters in words several times before they appear in the message, when I hold down the B to get a comma of the J to get the & sign it rarely works. The space bar sometimes works. This is a major issue that needs to be fixed & I can't find anywhere to text tech support or to report a problem 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30364:	  The app is great for secure messaging with a desktop client. However, there's a bug on my Pixel where anytime I swipe Signal from my recents, it closes the recents panel entirely, even if other apps are in the recents. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30397:	  Amazing open source app for security conscious people and those who work on sensitive issues. Highly recommended for journalists, human rights defenders, and marginalized groups. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30400:	  Great app overall but it doesn't work when I write offline and then connect. Signal only tries to send the message for a couple seconds before saying it couldn't send. I always use a VPN, which takes a few seconds to connect so I always have to resend every message. A longer timeout time or if it periodically tried again would fix this. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30403:	  I love this app for the security and privacy it gives. I have faced an issue whenever I try to listen a voice messenge it gives "Error Playing Audio!" but my friend doesn't have such problem. I guess it's because he is using Android 5.0 and I'm 7.1.1 ? 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30406:	  Security first make this a great app. Sadly, one can't register for it on a PC, tablet, Chromebook or any device that doesn't have a valid SIM card and a phone number, which means you'd also have to be paying a monthly fee to a greedy mobile provider. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30408:	  Only problem is all parties need to use it for encryption to matter however it integrates flawlessly over the stock messaging app so why not use it? 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30409:	  Clean, simple, doesn't get in the way. Exactly how it should be 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30410:	  This would be much more useful if it didn't truncate half of my longer incoming text messages. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30417:	  It's a good app, only issue is I can't figure out how to actually videocall people, even with the beta enabled. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30418:	  It always crashes especially during calls and it doesn't work well with messaging through the notification panel. Almost never works. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30420:	  Still waiting on MMS backup capability and dual-SIM support. And now I'm getting a "bad encrypted message" error from another Signal user. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30445:	  Sometimes have problems with calls, with clarity. Neither person can understand what the other is saying. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30448:	  It would be great if MMS images didn't fail so often, if I could send messages to multiple recipients, and if the new message indicator on the cool would go away when I have no new messages. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30451:	  NOT EASILY COMPATIBLE WITH GOOGLE VOICE. First time authentication should have the option to manually enter code and the option to call instead of text right from the get go instead of after failure 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30456:	  "Error downloading mms..." Never had this issue with Textra. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30465:	  Godsend for Android users who don't get a lot of these privacy and call features like message and call blocking. Also csn shut off message preview in notifications. Another surprisingly hard feature to find for Android users. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30470:	  The only 2 things I wish it had built in was to make custom vibrations for notifications and allow repeating until screen on and not just a set number that could be reached and time out without receiving notification. I use a third party app to configure a never ending, custom vibrating notification.... Average users would struggle setting up and sometimes need root. Thanks for the app, the Mic option to hold and send audio clips helps me ALL day being busy with kids and work!!! The beta video chat has not failed me yet and use it everyday on galaxy note 3 and s7 edge! RUN IT 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30471:	  I find it a great concept. However, the app fails to notify me on new incoming messages. This happens usually after I have not used the app for a short time. As if it shuts down by itself. So, I have to manually run the app periodically to look for new messages - which is impractical and renders the app not usable. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30485:	  The gold standard for private, secure, transparent, and independent IM and phone calls. Make Signal your default messenger app and recommend it to all your friends. We should care more about our privacy and a free society in general. To the developers: keep up the good job and don't get lazy. There is some fierce competition out there. Update 16/11/07: New features such as GIFY support are amazing. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30491:	  Unfortunately I'm not able to send videos or GIFs using Signal, no idea why. Does anyone have a fix? I have AT&T, Samsung Galaxy s6. I can receive them just fine. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30512:	  This app works better than my own messaging app! So far haven't had any problems with it. Well except that I'm not quite sure how to make it so other people have to have a lock on their app and enter a password so you know no one else can get to your messages. Or if you can even do that. And I want to know how I can be sure this is actually secure. Lol I don't even know how you would check that. Anyway, so far I really like it! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30527:	  Problems downloading MMS---that being said, the app is classy & easy to use. Great job. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30535:	  Video calling and calling feature is not working properly? 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30540:	  First, I love this app!!! Here just a small bug report: the Gif option only works when connected to wifi. Doesn't work with 4G. Would be cool to have that option too (got a mobile flatrate). 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30581:	  Unusable. Messages sent to other Android Signal or iOS Whisper users never arrive, unencrypted messages take 4-12hrs to arrive when sent from the app. Unencrypted messages sent to me arrive quickly, though. Tried extensive troubleshooting, but most recommendations were not applicable. The rest didn't work. Tried this on multiple occasions with no success. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30605:	  The phone function doesn't work on my AP, but other than that it's fantastic. I really like it. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30633:	  Recently, Signal fails to deliver messages on time. Sometimes, it is necessary to open the application to receive new messages, and I find it something really annoying in an app such this. I really want to use it, but this problem undermines its usability. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30639:	  Some bugs. When I go to close the app it will push me back to the home screen immediately. Sometimes the app will freeze and gifs can be really slow to load and use. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30640:	  I don't get any notification until and unless I open the contact on my app. Plz resolve the issue 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30647:	  DO NOT USE! Went haywire when I sent an sms with poor reception, sending it hundreds of times before I could shut my phone down to stop it. Manager thought this was intentional harassment and fired me! And it spammed through my carefully saved $150 credit! Bloody madness. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30660:	  Loved this app and it's functionality. However need one specific improvement. While texting via Google now or Google assistant the text I have sent don't show up in application. Fix that and I will give 6 star.. And also add in message search function. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30679:	  Really great app but I seem to have an issue I cannot solve myself. Not sure though if that's a Signal issue or a Nougat "feature". When I need to send special SMS to premium number (to subscribe or to pay for some service) I don't seem to be able to remove country code (+48) at the begining of the number and those numbers will not work that way... the have to be used without the country code (eg. 70XX). Is there a way to have it fixed inside the app itself? 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30687:	  Bug: following a secure call, subsequent calls will show only a black screen and do not dial or negotiate. The app must be force quit to make another call, please address. Also, photos are still too compressed. Thanks for your hard work. Privacy is freedom. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30715:	  I would like to use it but it crashes my phone's U.I...any solutions? 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30724:	  There's issues with delivery of texts to those users who have the Signal app installed, it is delayed to up to 6 hours. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30727:	  Great secure! Can you fix signal don't show notification when having message? 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30735:	  Update: it has serious lag. People don't get my messages, i don't get theirs, messages sent and received only once but show up multiple times. With a heavy heart, i have to uninstall. __________________ I get some messages multiple times, and my contacts report receiving multiples sometimes. Tried uninstalling/reinstalling, but that didn't help 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30739:	  I've gone from hating this app to appreciating is functionality for privacy. I don't get excited about it but it does the job. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30747:	  Nice app. Works fine. Haven't run into any problems. Keep up the good work! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30754:	  It is good to have a trusted and trustworthy channel of communications in this age of pervasive surveillance, not because we have something to hide, but because we have the right to privacy 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30759:	  It Uses+Obtains Device & ALL App's PRIVATE HISTORY (WebSite/URL LIST) & ALL SENSITIVE LOG Data & Precise GPS Location, Full Contact-List, Calendar Events-List !!! etc Which R VIOLATION Of People's Privacy-Rights & other Rights, AVOID THIS APP, OR Request Developers To Remove Those Features, OR Tell them to Release "Light" Edition w/o Excessive & UnNecessary Data Accesses, OR release a SEPARATE Signal-PLUGIN App which can access those Permission & this app connecting w/that Plugin via encrypted API. Users can manually copy-paste a contact-info if they want to when needed, so this app must not access user's Full Contacts-List. Even Law-Enforcement need Court-Order For Obtain Such Data ! it connects with External 3rdParty Servers (Amazon Cloud) ! it auto-restarts even after manually closing it from Ggl Apps-List !! When Developer/Group Wil Really Respect User's PRIVACY-RIGHTs, & Fix Those, Then We Wil Updat This Review Accordingly. Thanx. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30761:	  Reliability and usability is more important than security for average users. Encrypted calls and texts use data, which is fine, but this means they don't send when data is disabled or out-of-range. It's really annoying to try and get to the normal call/text mode when the Signal calls fail due to Internet issues. Please, if a message doesn't send over data after a set timeout, or a Signal call fails, Signal should prompt to ask to try again in normal non-encrypted mode. It's also more tedious to call people who don't use Signal, as the call doesn't begin automatically after pressing call if the other person is not on Signal, it just prefills their number. This difference in behaviour on the same UI is frustrating. A different colour for each person is jarring: I would prefer one colour for secure and one colour for insecure communications. There is also a bug where a draft text may be lost if Signal is minimised then a message comes through from the intended recipient and the user clicks on that notification - the draft is gone. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30762:	  Take the power back! Thank you developers! I got this for the messaging, so I can't comment on the functions of the phone. Once or twice SMS came in late from an iPhone (I have Android), but no other problems. Love it! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30769:	  I've been trying to get my phone calls not to drop when my screen blacks out but to no avail. Contacted Signal but no one knows how to fix the issue. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30783:	  It seems like the app will only work if you have wifi on??? Anyone having that issue? 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30794:	  The only issue is convincing your contacts to use the app, otherwise this is awesome. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30809:	  Occasionally doesn't show an image or emoji but usually fixes itself when I exit and reopen the app 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30810:	  I love the app. It's even set to my default SMS app. The only concern I have is that when I try to send a message to someone who HAD Signal before but deleted it, they don't get the message on their phone. It seems it sends the message to their app, but since they don't have it anymore, it gets lost. There should be a way to send messages to people that had Signal but don't anymore. It's really annoying, and I have to talk to some people on different apps because of this "glitch". If you could fix this, that would be fantastic!! Thanks  
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30835:	  The app is great and its now my default messaging app. The only issue I have is that when I do a search in the app, it only brings up contact names instead of searching inside of individual messages. Otherwise great and easy to use! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30837:	  After last update app crashes immediately after start. Please fix it. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30838:	  Still trying to figure out exactly how this thing works with sms - it seems to default to data use but sms messages aren't getting through to recipients for some reason. Aside from this issue, I love this app - and it really might be just my lack of time to figure out the learning curve. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30847:	  The best messaging app for those concerned with privacy. I especially like the timed automatic msg delete feature, it helps keep old msgs from taking up space and ensures sensitive msgs get deleted even if I forget. Signal has end to end encryption, is open source, and does not save the contents of msgs on their servers. This is evidenced by a recent court case where Signal was supeanoed (spelling?) to provide information but all they could provide was the time msgs were sent, even those that program the app did/do not have access to msg content. Support your right to privacy and encourage all your friends to switch to Signal! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30848:	  Conceptually good but I was disappointed to find that the "desktop" app is actually a chome extension a bit sad for an app that pushes privacy to require Google's browser in order to be installed. I'll stick with something else until they fix that. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30851:	  I don't get notifications till i open the app 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30860:	  Works faster than standard message app that came with phone. I haven't used encryption yet, but like the option. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30863:	  Great app, stopped using cuz the MMS didn't work. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30866:	  I've been through many other messanger apps and this one hits everything I need: desktop client, audio messages, and group messages and a few other tidbits. The encryption is a nice bonus. Never had hiccups or issues with it. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30870:	  When a contact uses signal and for some reason uninstalls the app there is no way to know it and he/she never takes your messages. Thats a very big important problem. Needs immediate fix. Other than that its the best app for communicating securely. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30875:	  Now it takes hours, minutes or days for texts send or receive...(update)...Much worse than before...It flat out doesn't work for MMS at all...Simple text works but with much delay. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30882:	  Overall, a good app, not sure if I'd recommend it to everyone, as it has difficulties with group MMSes sometimes. It also has problems with with notifications so I have to check my texts with the same habits as email. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30885:	  Calling has been an issue but messaging is great 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30895:	  Video calling feature (Beta) sometimes not working properly on Samsung Galaxy J5 and J7 (both 2016) 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30899:	  A "message read" option would be great, make it opt in for both people to avoid privacy problems. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30903:	  Completely replace SMS, so you can use if you don't use the other greater features, with all the benefits. Nice 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30908:	  Some random texts sent to my google voice number were not delivered. Since there was no error message, people thought that I just chose not to answer. I had to switch back to my default messaging app until this is fixed. Support was a let-down, not happy. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30921:	  It's easy to use, secure and open. The only problem I had was actually related to Google's Push Service, and Open Whisper Systems replied almost immediately. Could use a complete encrypted backup option, but that'd be a cherry on top of a perfect cake. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30944:	  This app replaced textra for me. I could not find a app that had a native quick reply button ON THE NOTIFICATION until now. This is a solid sms client and it looks great too. This is honestly a brilliant experience. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30961:	  Doesn't work, tried text verification, I got the text but app didn't do anything. Then tried phone verification and it kept incorrectly saying no network and then too many attempts. Immediately uninstalled. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30978:	  Amazing app. Just one tiny thing. Please make video compression possible. I can't upload 150MBs each time I upload a ten second video. Thanx And also add replies. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30984:	  Most recent update seems to have broken the calling feature. It does the sonar sound for a while and then the app crashes. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30994:	  Works fine for a while but then it fails to send image attachments. It may be a problem with my phone/carrier. I'll give it five stars if it works right on my next phone. Everything should be encrypted. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#30999:	  Easy to install. Easy to use. Installed on all the devices in my family, everybody uses without issues! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31003:	  The app used to work very well on my S6, but now will not close in 1 swipe. ALWAYS takes 2, and I know others have the same issue. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31016:	   Thanks for removing the bugs. I really love this app because of the security features it provides. Keep up the great job! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31024:	  Very solid app. I've had a few minor issues using my wifi only texting, but not enough to give less than 5 stars. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31029:	  I like signal. My only issue is that there does not appear to back a way to clear all chat messages. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31057:	  Problems downloading images received. Other than that, works great! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31059:	  I love the security of signal. But if you do more then occasionally text seek others. I have used it forever, back up texts constantly fails (it also doesn't back up pic messages) & the biggest flaw is signal condenses your pictures down to 90s Web cam quality when you send and receive them. I have contacted support several times over this & they just ignore me. I can't even make out faces in pictures people send me. Saving the photo does nothing to improve quality. Shame it would be awesome otherwise 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31064:	  Great and easy to use encryption. One problem -- if you switch phones your old contacts may not get push notifications when you send them messages because you have an unverified key. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31069:	  Since the update, I have had a constant "1" notification showing on the signal icon, whether or not I have a message. Please fix. Otherwise a great app. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31073:	  I love this app. I love knowing my messages are private. There are some issues with messages repeating over and over sometimes. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31119:	  Easy-to-use, secure messaging app. Calls can sometimes be slightly glitchy at first, but never had problems with the call. Highly recommended 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31130:	  I can't imagine why I'd use this over Telegram. Has anyone ever had a security issue with Telegram? Signal is great but just not as beautiful as Telegram and lacks some of the design and features. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31162:	  clean and bug free app. Needs more upfront features such as swipe to delete message thread like other similar messaging apps. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31163:	  i tried to set up my number but always not registered always written server not registered 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31164:	  Sometimes texts don't work, incoming and outgoing. sent images are very poor quality. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31174:	  Great in theory, but design choices cause problems. The hilariously small MMS size limit needs to be increased. It's 2017 already... 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31188:	  I don't have the tech knowledge to comment on its security capabilities, but in terms of user experience it's been pretty good. I like how you can set colours for the different people in your contacts list. Possible improvements: - Would prefer if those colours weren't the background to the text, and/or if you could set custom colours using CSS; in practice some of the preset colours aren't useful, because of insufficient contrast with the text, and even some of the usable ones are a bit glaringly bright for a background. - Had one experience where I'd run out of credit and it wouldn't send the message but didn't tell me why, and it took me a while to figure out. A more informative error message would've been useful at that point. I'm not sure if the phone gives Signal access to my phone credit level, so maybe it couldn't've actually told me why, but it could have had a "more info" link with "here's some things to check", and from memory I don't think it did. All in all though, thanks for making this useful app. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31203:	  I dwnlded the app on my Chromebook 2 and synced my phone and laptop but it's failing to import anything on to my laptop. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31206:	  Absolutely fantastic. Zero complaints or problems 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31231:	  It is a solid app. Two issues: it is a little cumbersome to set up a group text, but more importantly the indexing, when looking for a contact, is INCREDIBLY SLOW and sometimes doesn't even provide search results. This needs to be fixed. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31237:	  It's very good, but unfortunately it is not work in Egypt ! Please make it work in Egypt, we want to save our conversations .. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31244:	  doesn't work in Iran. it has no deactivate possibility. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31287:	  Since joining the signal family,I've not had any issue with sending secure Information to business colleagues or family and friends.It is bar none the best messaging app out there!!!! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31288:	  Great but a little buggy. I've replaced my sms app with signal but I've had lots of issues with the unread message badge on the app. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31289:	  Great app. Still has a bit of an issue with group chat. No video yet, but it's said to be on the way. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31304:	  Will not let me download, not even an option. Had it on old phone awhile ago. Has my correct email. What's up? Help, please. Just became beta video tester. Fix & I'll change to 5 stars toute-suite. Thank you 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31307:	  Very slow and the instant incoming message notification fails a lot 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31310:	  Had to stop using this app. Messages would come through in batches hours after they were sent. Sometimes sending messages failed to send at all with no feedback as to why. Calling didn't always work. I love the interface but it was completely unreliable as a way to send and receive text messages. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31325:	  Great way to securely send quick messages. Has an intuitive UI with no serious problems. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31331:	  This is by far the best messaging client I've tried so far! But it has a few bugs. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31353:	  This app doesn't work well on wifi, and struggles when iPhone users send me messages, even when they have signal themselves. I like the interface, but media messages are limited, and I don't get many texts until 40 minutes after they were sent if I'm on wifi. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31354:	  I have not used everything yet but so far do good. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31355:	  Great way to not get thrown in an upcoming gulag for expressing ideas contrary to the Administration's Truth as it is understood on a particular day 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31357:	  Don't know why, but Signal shows me some contacts multiple times. Tried to clean and remove duplicate contacts but it didn't help. Other than that I didn't have any problems, the banner to invite people is slightly annoying though. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31358:	  It crashes at random times but overall it's ok 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31364:	  Allows for linked desktop computer clients. Can't link other devices though. And SMS don't sync across clients so it gets a little confusing 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31366:	  Having issues on the Samsung mobile to show the number of ongoing conversations 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31384:	  ... But the MMS image quality sucks. Fix please. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31407:	  So a new problem has arisen, though I'm not really sure it's Signal. Something's cutting off texts from iPhone users that are very long. I guess I'll test and see. Update: Samsungs default messenger didn't cut off when I had the person copy paste the same message. Might be Signal after all, I guess. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31430:	  It has some issues like listening to the audios and media your contacts send you (you hear them loud voice instead of just for yourself). The videos don't play smoothly. I hope you can fix it soon. Nevertheless what I have just said I think this app it's one of the best if you want to preserve your anonymity. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31436:	  As of this version the app is barely usable because of message rendering bugs. It keeps getting worse instead of better. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31443:	  The best and most secure chat app. Could you try and fix the double messeges in groupchats? It's been a serious problem and a reason to stop using signal for my friends. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31447:	  I like that it's open source and has good encryption only downside is that it won't work if you don't have data so I mostly stuck with the default SMS App 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31449:	  Secure but not stable, less features than wire or telegram. Crash too often. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31451:	  Crashing, and problems with SMS. Failure to send, and sending a reply hundreds of times. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31453:	  Does what it says, haven't had any issues 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31455:	  Good for texts but when I used it to call someone the sound wuality was poor and had lots of dropped calls. I didn't get it for calling anyway so not a big deal. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31461:	  Excellent personal info security! Have some intermitent blocking issues sending from outside US to US contacts also using Signal, 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31468:	  Besides it telling me every new contact that downloads it I like the app. Also get rid of the so and so just joined signal message them. But then it reminds you over and over again if you don't open a chat window kind of annoying. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31476:	  Very well designed app. The interface is familiar and modern and the experience is fast and responsive. The encryption feature is a huge draw and the sms support is a nice bonus. My only issue is the lack of Android wear support. If Android wear was supported I would likely switch to signal as my daily sms driver. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31507:	  1 bug 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31508:	  A simple, secure messaging service. And it's open source. It's the best (text based) messaging choice at the moment. However, there are a few issues. Notably syncing. If you haven't been on a device for a while, prepare to sit and wait while all the messages sync. Also loses one star for being dependent on Google Play Services. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31513:	  Seems like this update was not properly debugged. The date sticky seems to be the problem. Now all my messages jump around. Multiple duplicates. Missing messages. Messages out of order. What a mess. First they dumbed down the time stamp on the messages after an hour, now this. Lets go back to the simple and precise 24 hour military time possible time stamps on every message. The app is getting too complicated and with these bugs I'm can't help but ask myself if this app is secure enough anymore. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31518:	  Great app. Only issue is call sound quality. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31520:	  Problems with MMS, texting more recipients fails as well. Doesn't recognize groups from Google account nor internal (Samsung). Annoying invite pop up at every contact for the first time. Otherwise a decent app. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31524:	  It sucks. Buggy. Greedy about storeage space. Usually fails to send message4 notifications 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31530:	  Issues with clear voice conversations, especially if you try to use speaker. That I do not like, cause I can't put calls on speaker. Pain in the old .... 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31532:	  Good app that is secure and replaces the existing messenger app without any problem. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31535:	  Sometimes the messages take a long time to get through, McClung this app unreliable. Please fix. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31536:	  I started using Signal as main SMS client and it's excellent, much better than any of Google's offerings. At the moment few of my contacts use it, so I don't use the cryptographic features at all. But hopefully people will come for the SMS and stay for the free cryptography. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31547:	  App has issues messaging with iPhone users. Some iphone users have a signal account, but either don't get notifications or have uninstalled the app. The solution is of corse to send messages as sms, but It's difficult to force this app to send messages as mms. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31552:	  Great texting app all around. Security never hurts, I like having an extra password on my communication and knowing that it's encrypted. Features between other signal users work well. Only downside is the slightly-too-frequent updates that cause issues. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31559:	  Just a little buggy on Android. Secure, easy to install. Having some problems with texts, pics, but it brought all my old messages over when I installed it as default messenger 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31570:	  Works great haven't had any problems using this app except for some reason my custom notification tones (music ones) do not seem to work. Not sure if I need to change something or not. Other then that great app!!! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31580:	  After using this for a couple of weeks, I am done with it. Works for about 24 hours and then I have to unregister and then register again for it to work. Unable to find a solution. Galaxy S7. Have submitted multiple bug logs. No response. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31583:	  Problem received mms 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31587:	  Text messaging with Signal works fine. Voice calls don't work at all. All I see when I try to call someone is a black screen. Other applications like WhatsApp and Hangouts don't have that problem on my phone. Another problem I have had is that Signal won't let me send video recordings. The app complains that the message is too large and exceeds its limit -- even though the video runs just for a minute. Other tools don't seem to have this issue. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31607:	  Great app, I have not encountered any bugs, glitches, of anything of the sort, very user friendly, and actually private highly suggested 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31618:	  Update: the app works fine e with imessage, but gives a notification of undeliverable when I'm texting another Android user. This means I won't know when my recipients actually do not receive my text. This app has two issues 1 i can live with and one I cannot. 1) Messages won't send over WiFi. 2) when delivering messages the phone sometimes give delivery error messages that seem to be untrue. In my own testing the issues seem to be that the the app doesn't play well with iMessage. The Debug system they use can't capture the issue so for them it doesn't exist. Their answer is to turn off notifications for all message so I never have delivery confirmation. I say fix the app. They say no. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31630:	  So easy to use there is no excuse not to use it! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31635:	  Did seem secure at first but i have had some issues wheee people i send to loses or changes security number but when I talk to them they had no change that ahould cause this. Leavees me to think its been hacked. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31639:	  Find this excellent..no problem with it at all. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31652:	  And this coming from someone who didn't download it for security reasons either. It's best feature in my eyes is its blazing speed. I might uninstall over the "Invite to Signal" banner at the top of every conversation though. It's obnoxious. There are also few in the way of customization options. I would at the very least like an option to remove all contact photo bubbles. That alone would make me like it a lot more. Edit: Please get rid of the sticky time stamps. They're too big and draw my eye away from the text. The old implementation was better. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31670:	  The main problem with group sharing is that you can't tell people's names if they're not in your contact list. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31678:	  After making one voice call, i am unable to make another voice call to same person. This is a very serious bug 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31681:	  Amazing but one big and one request. Bug: when using the direct reply feature on 7.1.1, signal sometimes crashes when trying to send a message. Request: RCS!! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31695:	  Currently having an issue with notification not resetting to zero (no number next to icon) after I've read everything. How do I fix this? 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31706:	  MMS messages just keeps spinning and doesn't download for some reason 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31725:	  Looks nice, but pesters you constantly to advertise to your contacts (every single time you start a new conversation that it hadn't seen before) and pops up wanting you to rate it. Also has iPhone emoticons for some reason so it doesn't look consistent with anything else on your phone (this can be turned off, but it's an annoying default that doesn't make much sense). Also the server doesn't federate and you can't run your own. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31739:	  Great. An app that is both free, open source, easy to use, and can't be intercepted. Call quality is excellent. There's a desktop version too! The biggest problem is that it takes over from your default phone app and caller ID often doesn't work. "Reset secure session" wipes your message history on desktop. Could really do with a way to customize the invite message. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31749:	  Love it only one annoying bug 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31762:	  I've had some issues with poor signal causing errors in message delivery, especially mms. But overall I love the app. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31778:	  No runtime permissions. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31783:	  I don't use the encryption feature I just use it for sms's and it's absolutely awesome just to do that! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31805:	  Easy seamless integration, my only complaint is that I'm in a low service area and signal doesn't send insecure text over wifi. It's a feature not a bug. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31807:	  Great app, reduced the stars because I recently switched to Project Fi on a Pixel XL; works flawlessly for texting and receiving calls, but for some reason I cannot make calls. Please fix, thank you! Update: well it was fixed for a little, but I don't know what happened, calling doesn't work at all anymore!! It's like this app is deteriorating :( 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31810:	  The only issue i have is that sometimes signal to signal messages are delayed upwards of a day. Sms doesnt have this issue, though. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31815:	  Loved the app at first! Downside is you have to make it your default message app and import all contacts. Would not let me use mms no matter what i did! So to uninstall it destroys all messages you save and you can't get them back after going back to your old messaging app! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31816:	  Good, apart from when messages fail to send. Should auto retry. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31832:	  I love this app. Everything is great about it, except for a couple of minor issues: 1, the picture compression is a bit more "harsh" than other standard messaging apps. 2, the group messaging feature is less convenient than the standard app (at first). Once you get it all set up though you get used to it. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31835:	  Not able to place call.please fix it.great app. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31844:	  Just getting started. So far so good. One weirdness was when attempting SMS to a phone number off the desktop app. Rejected the text with "unregistered number" error message. We have to be able the sent to unsecured respondents too... 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31856:	  Very user-friendly, completely replaces your phone's default messenger app without issues. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31865:	  MMS images sent to my galaxy s7 fail and I can't ever see them. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31866:	  Great interface even if your friends don't use encryption (which everyone should). 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31871:	  It's got some issues sending and receiving regular messages to people who are using regular SMS messaging. As well, it's got additional issues in that area for sending multimedia messages, like photos. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31892:	  voice calls cause had connections issues recently, but beside that a perfect messenger 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31896:	  I haven't had any problems with the app and I love that it's secure. I tell all my friends about it, definitely glad I got it :) 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31904:	  Sometimes send or sharing a file is a problem. Also sendng a link from YouTube. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31909:	  I haven't used all the functionality of the device because of can't use it with my smart watch (Samsung gear s3), however for secure messaging I will be using and encouraging other friends to use it. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31910:	  This is a good app. The issues that I have had is the delay in receiving messages on more to than occasion. Other than that, the app is good, but not being able to get messages in a timely manner, that's a big negative. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31916:	  First no contacts, cannot send any msg to anyone. After full data delete and re-reg, msg ok but calling not working, did not ring out at other end. Only other party can call me. The call quality: other party cannot hear me just quietly (in other apps it is ok). 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31919:	  Great application, only issue is notifications being iffy on iPhones everything else  
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31931:	  Works really well. Only reason it got 4 stars is that it very occasionally crashes, but my phone is old and most apps crash now and then. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31938:	  I like the app. My biggest problem is how complicated the setup set up. You need to put a lot of numbers in front of your phone number if you what encrypted messages. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31945:	  Fake limmitations and ratings are unknown with false positives to say true rating fixed not score actualls! This should be unrated because it uses provision intents within apps 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31952:	  Resolves HIPAA compliance issue 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31963:	  Excellent. Too bad it doesn't work without data transfer enabled. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31968:	  I cannot download images. I sent an email for help and I received no response 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#31969:	  It's a nice clean app, but having issues with sending SMS's. "SmsSentJob: Service connectivity problem, requeuing..." which is weird because I receive them just fine. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32009:	  A lot of bugs 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32032:	  Only problem is can't send message to multiple contacts at the same time. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32045:	  Good app with potential. It's hard to compete with the other messaging apps since you have to convince people to switch. Also, it only supports verifying your identity with your phone number, so you can't use it with only data. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32051:	  A very good and needed app. If only it had more blocking and muting options i would have used it as the default sms app. EDIT: be carefull when using this app to sent secure text if it is also set as your sms app.if the network secure send fails it sends it as plain text sms with no way to change this behavior . 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32052:	  Facing issues for calling after updating to Nougat 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32059:	  Voice calling are only possible within the same flat, on the same wifi network. We are all awaiting for resolving this problem with our deep thanks. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32063:	  Good security, and it doesn't get in your way! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32068:	  Only complaint is that it doesn't work as good as most other apps on Android wear. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32112:	  Love it except did update and now it doesn't work 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32135:	  Great app! Unfortunately voice calls don't work sometime. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32138:	  Crashes non stop on note 5 since last os update. Drains battery and will not run 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32144:	  The app is not supporting gifs in gBoard. Went from being crossed out to an error about size limits. Can send screen shot. I don't have a GitHub acct. Otherwise, 5 stars! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32148:	  Fewer people use it so it doesn't work to it s full potential 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32162:	  Crashes sometimes, otherwise it's awesome 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32178:	  Love Signal. Only as good as your contacts who are willing to join though. And the inability to attach multiple attachments such as pics to a single text is annoying. Also I do have an issue with delayed receipt of texts very frequently. Not sure if this is a Signal server issue or carrier issue. Overall great privacy app. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32191:	  Very slow and delivery of messages fail consistently 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32195:	  It does not deliver messages anymore now 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32198:	  Error to call between two Saudi phone number 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32204:	  + insane that they are even bringing Android auto support which is plain amazing - Why can't I enter the code directly if sms verification fails without having to press call me button * hope they can add video to it * having trouble registering old account from a new phone 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32213:	  Sometimes I get the same message twice, many days apart... 5 stars when this bug is fixed! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32230:	  No dual SIM support. Cannot register Signal for both sim cards. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32243:	  Great app. Not customisable but I don't really care. It does crash every now and then. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32248:	  Can't register, keep showing connectivity error 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32257:	  Actually this app sucks pretty BAD. It allowed me to send a GIF 3 times, then it stopped for no reason. Cannot send pictures or GIFS. This app sucks....do not download. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32261:	  Awesome if it works, but it constantly drops calls or fails to connect even when both phones are on WiFi. Call quality is bad compared to e.g. WhatsApp. Does not signal when call drops, and will completely drop call instead of reconnecting if the other person doesn't have Internet for a few seconds. Used to also have issues where messages often were delivered minutes or hours later despite both phones having Internet - that seems to have improved but current version drops calls exactly every 10 min. Edit: now calls don't work at all. Splendid! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32264:	  Great app, except it keeps crashing on me. I'm not giving up on it yet, but I'm close. Too bad because in all other respects, it's excellent 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32265:	  The app was fine till the most recent update. Any time you have to go to the middle of a word to fix it, the delete removes every word and letter to the right of the cursor. And when you delete from the end of a sentence, it adds words that weren't previously there and takes forever to delete. Would have given 5 stars before the update messed it up. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32266:	  Multimedia messages sometimes fail to go through. Otherwise, a solid messenger app 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32270:	  It works good. It has some minor annoyances such as hassles me to rate it before I can get a good feel for its ultimate abilities, hassles to get all my contacts on board by hassling them like a used auto sales man whose overwhelmingly trying to do things I am not ready to do without even giving me time for doing research and time for considerable consideration. Hassles false notifications constantly. Annoying and tacky marketing. I cannot get app for my tablet. If they would stop hassling me to do this review and get a chance to get to test it out fully, I may be giving it a 5 star rating. Other than that, I still need to run my default messing app and that app has access to my network and possibly still can see what is going on with my data even if it is encrypted. I still need to see how that goes. I have a bachelor in IT risk management and Cyber security and really need more time to give a better rating. Otherwise, so far it seems like a good app for the most part on it's functionality. tablet 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32291:	  I love the mobile app however the Desktop app lacks polish. More importantly you can only connect a maximum of three devices to your account. A person with a mobile phone, home laptop and home desktop therefore cannot use the desktop app from a work desktop or laptop. This seems very limiting, especially since people tend to have multiple devices at home and work. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32317:	  I used to be vary happy with this but after the latest update im.unable to set signal as my default and app anymore. Fix this and I will rate 5 star 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32330:	  Finally! A customizable messaging app that works. MMS, GIF, text - it all works. Unfortunately, most of my friends do not seem concerned about the relative unsecured nature of other text messaging apps and haven't signed up. Even though, it works. Need better pop-up options though. But after going through 13 other apps that I had issues with, I'm very pleased 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32413:	  Cool app makes you feel safe but cannot download MMS messages or group text. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32426:	  Good food is secure but annoying that it constantly promotes itself, asking you to contact anyone you message who hasn't downloaded it yet, which is most people 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32438:	  Great Application, works quickly and accurately. You don't get datamined. Highly recommended if you value your privacy & security. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32440:	  MMS messages fail to download on AT&T Moto X (2015), and there don't seem to be any manual MMS settings to attempt to debug things. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32441:	  This is a small and tidy SMS application that will do everything you need it to do. It's fast, easy to use, and seamlessly handles real SMS (with those who don't have Signal) and secured messages. Personally, I prefer it to other leading SMS apps, even without the security asset. The main problem is that there are very few users. The only person I actually have secured messages with, I persuaded to download the application. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32442:	  Excellent texting app, the encryption is totally seamless, no user set-up required. Just want to acknowledge the uphill battle the devs have so marvellously won - not only is this the most secure texting app on the market, but it competes with and exceeds most other texting apps. Download it, you won't be disappointed. Update: the encrypted calls lag by about three seconds. If your first concern is a private conversation, it'll do, but it's not really a drop-in replacement for regular calls. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32465:	  It's almost perfect. It stops working sometimes in my Moto G4. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32466:	  I'm impressed so far. Haven't had any problems. I believe in people's right to privacy and shame on any government that invades that based on false claims and fear mongering. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32477:	  I love the privacy features of this app, but I find it odd that you can't use voice recognition to create a text. I don't want to send an audible message within my messaging app, I just want to have a hands-free option. If this were possible, I'd bump up my stars! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32479:	  I really like this app as a texting app and using it for private messaging. But the one thing that is super annoying is that there is no MMS options. 300kb is just too small. I can text gifs to signal users just fine but regular text doesn't work. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32506:	  Superb! Very easy to use and never any bugs. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32512:	  It works just fine. Getting more people to join is the problem... 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32526:	  Doesn't seem to work with T-Mobile MMS. Hopefully that will be fixed soon, as I'd love to use this app. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32530:	  Dev sees no privacy problem in using Google's Play Service. And the servers needed for routing are based in NYC - witch meens that all connections are going through the USA. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32535:	  Fantastic app but doesn't work properly with pushbullet, making it inconvenient at times 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32551:	   Indistinguishable from normal SMS. Works with other Signal users or (non-encrypted) anyone else. I can't figure out how to make the LED blink, but that's likely an Android configuration issue. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32561:	   The UI is clean, no lag whatsoever and it works seemlessly. Don't feel the need for SMS or MMS at all. The only drawbacks are opportunities to get more people on-board (which I feel would make Singal overthrow others) and fix minor feedback like scheduling messages etc. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32569:	   Must have app. Red phone integration is awesome but still has issues, latency and sometimes just no sound. Overall  app. Thank you 5 STARS * * * * * all the way! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32579:	   Works well. Only crashed once so far in the couple of weeks I've used it as my default sms. Wish you could have favorite contacts at the top like Samsung's native app. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32580:	   Love the security and wifi messaging. HATE the page of privileges needed for this app. Seriously guys? Recently started crashing with one of the updates or a change in carriers. Haven't opened a report/bug yet. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32587:	   I have loved using signal for a very long time however since updating to the newest it keeps crashing. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32592:	   Love the app! But has major bugs. Like when u type something ans u send it. If u want to type another message the app repeats ur sentence. Please work on bugs, will give 5 stars then! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32594:	   Super APP mit tollem Aufbau. Teilweise ein paar Bugs. Edit 17.1.17 : tells me that their is a Problem and app breaks down 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32595:	   Can only trim messages not delete and trim does not work. Huge security issue. Other than that works fine but since that was intentional all security in app is questionable in my book. Data sanitization is a tennant of security. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32608:	   Good secure app but notifications are not working in my case even if Signal has all authorisations in its settings and in system settings. Tried cleaning cache+data erase + phone factory reset many times. Even tried with Nova launcher+TeslaUnread. Problematic cause I need to check manually. Android 6, FlymeOS 5, Meizu M3 Max. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32627:	   I have an LG G5 and found this app to be full of glitches. It constantly fills my notifications pull down with notifications of new contacts available. It also refuses to fetch MMS messages, showing a connection error every time. I had high hopes. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32629:	   This app is easy and fixed my problems working with iOS users! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32633:	   App works great. The reason why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is due to the app crashing once in a while when replying from the notification bar. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32637:	   Not a single problem so far, great app 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32643:	   Privacy is paramount for liberty. This gives you privacy. The encrypted VOIP calls are better than my service provider. Crystal clear. A great way to get others interested in privacy issues. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32645:	  Doesn't work without data connection. Uninstalled. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32650:	   ...but from a while, the updating process give an error code "-11", and i don't know what to do. Any solution? (android 2.3.4 on a Samsung i9000) 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32694:	   Simple app, even if you send text to someone who haven't the app installed, it send a simple text (SMS). The only "bug" is when writing a long message, the message window doesn't enlarge and we have to scroll through. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32709:	   The app is wonderful and has been working perfect. However the most recent update has caused the app to crash randomly when opening, without any other reason. Droid Turbo, Android 6.0.1 and kernel version 3.10.40 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32712:	    on Motorola X Pure T-Mobile Network. What's the Fix? 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32713:	   Very frequently my texts arrive hours or even a day late! It's caused several misunderstandings already and I am thinking of going back to my old app, unless this bug is fixed soon. Would be sorry to do so, though. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32723:	   The only issue I have encountered is the appearance there are two instances of the application running when selecting "close all" applications in Android. Other than that, awesome application. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32732:	   Call quality and reliability (people calling me or messaging me and I not getting either) not quite there. Also want to have a 'schedule measage' option. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32740:	   Wish for a way to save drafts. Lately been crashing at regular use-intervals. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32741:	   Easy to use, came highly recommended. Only problem I have had is that it doesn't alert to my Gear2 but that is probably user error and I just need to figure it out. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32743:	   MMS does NOT work on T-Mobile! There used to be a feature that supported T-Mobile MMS but it got removed. Now it won't display any group texts or URLs or pictures! Great privacy if app is locked. NEEDS FEATURES for: search within messages in a chat/string, need the ability to select-all messages to delete from within a string, the ability to lock individual messages to protect from deletion, and the addition of a private inbox with stealth mode to further secure private messaging. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32745:	   Hi-signal engineers. The software does not work in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Because of the serious filtered by the government.we must use VPN for use Signal.. Please try to fix the problem. Thanks 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32750:	   Would like to have the ability to set separate notifications for sms and signal chats. Sms search also doesn't work. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32764:	   I cannot get past the setup. I can reserve the confirmation text but then It says connectivity error. Unable to connect to server. I am using a red mi note 3. In Singapore. Not sure if there is anyway to fix. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32766:	   Notifications often don't work for incoming messages using Android 4.4.6 - it does not notify until I manually re-open the app. Finally switch back to Whatsapp which does better with notifications. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32777:	   I was in the process of setting up signal. It failed to verify sms. The next option was to call my phone and provide me with a code. I did this three times. No call. The third time it said I tried too many times and must wait 20 minutes. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32793:	   Doesn't work in Thailand. Registration SMS never goes through. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32811:	   This is poor coding my friends. So anyone in my contact list of 800 friends family and business contacts just shows up in Signal (without permission) and I can't remove them. This needs to be fixed. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32815:	   This app provides the exact privacy I was looking for minus one big problem. Though u can disable the screenshot feature. Who ever yr msging can easily have it off. Giving them the ability to have record of anything you send them 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32818:	  Only issue is the calling never connects for me.but otherwise great. Issue fixed in settings 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32829:	  It's a great app, but I wasn't receiving notifications until I opened the app. It seems like this might have been fixed in the latest update, but I haven't received enough messages to know for sure. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32843:	   Overall, this is the best messaging app I've found for easy-to-use encrypted communication. The big issue for me is the lack of backup/restore for media messages. I wish I could've migrated more than just the plain-text when switching to a new device. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32845:	   No text searching, I occasionally get bad encryption messages and have to reset. An issue absent on other e2e encryption Apps. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32856:	   It shows too many errors of bad encrypted message !! Please fix this 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32860:	   The app tries to auto verify the text message it sends you, but it doesn't let you put the code in yourself, so if it fails to detect your code you have to wait 2 minutes before you can try again or try the phone call. Terrible system. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32871:	   After the last update. The app keeps crashing every time i open the app. Opens up a message next thing you know. Crashed 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32884:	   UPDATE: After new update. I sent the same Picture like yesterday (231k). Today it is 1.06M. That is way too much for mobile connections. For Comparison: Threema (good enough quality) --&gt; 81k. + Some things are missing: + Multidevice + run without gappz + remove user from group not working + view and scroll through all media from a conversation + Chrome App should be improved + iOS App is always behind the Android app which is difficult to communicate to ios users. Anyways thanks! I use signal a lot! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32894:	  If end-to-end encryption and privacy is most important to you, this is a great option. If you decide to switch back, though, there's a hole where your Signal messages were. Also, my company firewall blocks Signal, so if I forgot to turn off wifi at work, I wouldn't get any messages. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32898:	   As a messaging app it's okay, but basic. Messages can sometimes be delayed by long periods (20+ minutes). Unable to search conversations. Camera doesn't work when the screen rotates. Galaxy S6. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32900:	   Crash app every day! support does not respond to tickets .  
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32901:	   Disappearing messages do not reliably disappear in the time you say. Sometimes they stick around days too long. This needs to get fixed. Also, I don't like that I have to use my phone number, which is tied to my identity. It would be nice to have a more anonymous service 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32907:	  App is works great, still some bugs, Gboard gif attachment are to large to insert gifs. I like where the app is going from writing to edit photo in the app, I would like to see RCS to this one day. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32916:	   Awesome Sauce, had some bugs with calls not connecting periodically but only temporarily. All in all my favorite app, privacy is paramount in this nosy Government world we live in! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32929:	   Cannot backup messages, transfer messages, or revert (back to Messages) with this app. Once your messages are on Signal, they belong to signal, you cannot move them. Most ridiculous frustrating situation I've ever experienced with an app. No updates at all on a working SMS exportation. Don't believe the hype. Never again. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32932:	   I love Signal's focus on security and privacy, which might be its killer feature. Integration with SMS also makes the switch easier, since not all your contacts need to be there. Unfortunately, there are still bugs that needs to be ironed out and therefore it's not my primary messenger of choice. One annoyance: when dismissing a notification, it will randomly pop up at a later time only showing the phone number of your contact. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32941:	   Trying to get others to use it though is the only downside. I also don't use it for SMS only signal to signal conversions. I found I just don't like this nearly as much as Textra for just straight texting, but as an encryption app it's fantastic if the other person uses it. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32949:	   This AP is not that hard actually it's easy in comparison to the other APS I tried. It can be super secure if you want (have to invite people to join) or just text which is what I was use to. One person said my attachments did not work but no one else complained. I will keep this AP! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32962:	   Had a couple of issue, but this was a friend reinstalling the system... Straightforward and effective 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32965:	   Pretty random, but 10-20 minutes into a call the call drops and I get a frozen screen. I can't receive calls and attempting to make them returns me to the same frozen screen. I have to force close the app everytime just to work another 10 minutes. SMS is always severely delayed and sometimes doesn't notify you at all. Critical issues. I have a Google pixel. There should be no excuse. How this has 5 stars is a testimony to fake reviews on the Google store. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#32997:	   Voice calls fail more often than not. Messaging works great though. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33006:	   Everything about this app is great except that it doesn't display new msg indicator. Perhaps it's my Nexus 5P or perhaps user error, but it drives me nuts! The other little queries is when I swipe to close the app it takes me back to the home screen, so I have to reopen the panel of open apps again. Otherwise, this app should be rated 5 stars. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33009:	   Sending sensitive texts is always a touchy issue and since far, so good on this,app delivering on its promise! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33037:	   Keep improving the app's reach. So far good. But make sure u don't get sold like WhatsApp.. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33044:	   I couldn't find a messaging app I liked. I have been using this and it's great. Syncs with your Google contacts. The dark theme is great. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33050:	   App stops working from time to time. Needs video conference 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33054:	   Don't use anything that any more and if people don't switch, I don't message then, too easy to set up not to 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33057:	   Since none of my contacts uses Signal, encryption is irrelevant. As a replacement for my default messaging app (Textra) it performs less well in most respects. It often fails to notify of new messages; it is unreliable in sending messages ( contacts report receiving the same message multiple times); some messages never arrive; sending pics is flaky (file size limit). Could be good but chicken and egg situation regarding userbase numbers. I'll uninstall and revert to Textra for now but keep an eye on it. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33065:	   No noticed problems. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33087:	   The app is good but in Egypt 7 Jan 17 still can't connect via normal way oy via vpn please find a way to fix it 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33088:	   Sleek app for sending private messages and SMS. A few kinks needs to be worked out with group texts/MMS. I get error messages before receiving MMS and wished you didn't have to create a group first to send out group messages. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33090:	   It constantly crashes 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33115:	   Great app. Fantastic focus on privacy. Tiny bugs sometimes noticeable that don't affect performance or user experience. I prefer it to a well known other messaging app, even though it doesn't have its extended features. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33122:	   I do not receive some sms which is a real problem! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33127:	   Good for sending texts and cat photos, the call feature could use some work. So far so good, though! EDIT: 13 Dec 2016 - unfortunately, when Signal freezes (app won't open), and you follow the advice to uninstall/reinstall, you will lose ALL the messages you've exchanged between when you started using the app and when the breakdown occurs...so backup your messages whenever possible! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33134:	   And was not impressed. But this app, I love! I have not had one problem with it. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33135:	   I haven't run across any of my contacts with the app. Maybe more aggressive advertising. I like the idea of the possibility of encrypted messaging. I most dislike giving to create groups. If this app can be streamlines to operate similar to the traditional apps in respect to sending to more than one recipient that would really upgrade the usability. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33149:	   The ONLY problem I have with Signal is its enormous background battery drain. My battery lasts only half as long if I don't close Signal from the tasks page after every use (text, call, etc.). 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33164:	   Web addresses doesn't open when clicked and there is no option to go from the message to the contact who send it. Doesn't work without data network when you can usually send ordinary SMS without any problem without data network. Also can't share/send pictures directly from the Galery. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33165:	   My only whine is that it doesn't get Facebook im. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33172:	   despite some missing features compared to the big messengers and a few bugs and rough edges, it's still the only viable crypto messenger with open source code, e2e cryptography, perfect forward security, even trying to protect against censorship 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33175:	   I like the way it works, and the company philosophy. Would be nice to have an active icon that shows the number of unread messages, but that's a very small issue. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33176:	  Was awesome until I realised this was causing me to NOT receive important security SMS messages. I have two-factor authentication for many accounts, and with Signal installed, I don't receive text messages from the providers. I have to send a SMS from another phone first, then request another code for Signal, and this stupid "hack" fixes the issue for a few minutes. After that, it stops receiving SMS from providers again. I have a Mi Fit that vibrates when I receive an SMS. It confirms that a SMS has arrived since it vibrates immediately when I request a cod, but nothing on Signal. This is a GLARING bug. What use is security if you can't use the app at all. :( 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33181:	   Highly recommended - everyone should use this. New black theme is awesome. Please provide further style options (e.g. disable displaying contact pictures - many people don't use these). 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33182:	   Designed really well as a pure sms app. The fact that it also provide secure chat is a great bonus. Had dome issues receiving an mms but not important to me. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33189:	   Also having issue receiving notifications on most recent version. Running 7.1.1 and app also requests unlock password on launch, only after unlocking does the notification get pushed through along with any new messages. Best messaging app out there other than this recent bug! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33216:	   Warning! Signal crashed when i tried to find contact while writing sms and purged my call log and all contacts! I had to revert to my 3 years old backup. Backup your contacts! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33220:	   I ma not sure about security but otherwise the app works well for instant messenger. Voice calls don't work well 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33231:	   This app overall has all the basics of a solid texting app like Textra with the added benefit of encryption. However it's in the little details where it lacks and has bugged me enough to switch back to Textra. I tried listing all the little annoyances but ran out of room. Each annoyance is small but adds up to a frustrating experience. Once these little details are sorted out I'd love to come back and use this as my main texting app. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33234:	   I have only been using it for a few days but so far it has been pretty good. The only thing that I have had an issue with was that I am unable to use other 3rd party apps like MightyText to be able to send texts from my PC and the Signal Web app only works between two people that have Signal already installed 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33237:	   Loved it and used it on all my devices, but it stopped notifying me of incoming messages anymore unless I manually open the app. Fix please 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33245:	   Fully encrypted, free, doesn't register as a text on your bill. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33246:	  This app is the absolutely first app I have had not one single problem with, it is user friendly, simple and yet secure. The developers of this app got it right on . I have a my friends using it as well. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33249:	   I would give it a 5 but it crashed once, forcing me to reinstall. Was a huge pain to lose all my conversations. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33251:	   Want Marlinspike's encryption but without all the social media hoopla? This is the app for you. Easy to set up and register security fingerprints with the only the people you really wanna securely chat with. no annoying, hundreds of "so in so is using us! say hi to them" or "go bug all your friends in your contact list to use this app!" type stuff. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33252:	   It's a great app, and I love the privacy aspect. Two issues that keep it at 4 stars: (1) you cannot spontaneously text multiple people, you must create a group first, and (2) under heavy load the keyboard stutters and you have to click again to type; never had that with the built-in messaging app. (Used on Droid Mini) 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33257:	  Overall a great messaging app - though has some bugs 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33261:	   This is one of the best texting app on the market. Never had any issues receiving /receiving texts 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33263:	  Seems to be very interesting, but sadly it doesn't work with MIUI 8.0 I'll definitely update my review if I'm able to use it in the future. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33281:	  I can't get along without this program. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33294:	  Clunky and when friend got new phone # i deleted old one and saved new # in phone. However when try to call keeps reverting back to old number. The old contact # keeps coming back into list. Now have 2 numbers for this person and can't get rid of old number. Pretty pathetic. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33303:	   Does everything it claims to, and for free. Been using it for some time without issue 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33313:	  Just doesn't get any better than this! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33317:	   very late to update??? very Very slow and poor Too much time late to Download video?(Iran and Indonesia) I have Galaxy note 4 Android 6.0.1 Internet 4G LTE Please use.... The encrypted combination 3072bit or 4096bit RSA and 384bit or 512bit SHA for maximum security. All messages are deleted from the server after delivery. Thanks fixed and update 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33337:	  Usable, but many bugs 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33351:	   I was impressed at how easy it is to use. So much so I still wonder if it really encrypts text and especially voice as it says it does. I know it does but so seemless... Not used to tech being so smooth lol. The call quality is top, no lag. And I used it across the Atlantic 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33352:	   Still a few stability issues on an Android Nexus 6, e.g. sometimes trying to call someone leads to the UI remaining half empty. It seems to happen when two people call each other at the same time. But it's not a bad issue. I can recover by killing the process. I also *really* wish there was a better way to transition when I need to factory reset my device; e.g. encrypted message backup and/or some transition key to cryptographically secure one's intent to reinstall or move to a different device. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33353:	   My only issue is that not all my messages are received if a person is not using this app. It doesn't seem compatible with all Messaging apps. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33361:	   Cant verify phone number. No sms code, no call. Fix it! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33362:	   It seems like each of my friends is on a different app. I love that signal replaces my sms, so it doesn't seem like yet another damned messenger. The problem is that if signal isn't open in memory, it won't notify the recipient of a message. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33371:	   Had some problems before but its good now 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33375:	   Great app. It's stable and has never crashed or hung up. I love that it's open source. It has easily and quickly become my preferred mms/sms application. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33376:	   Never had a single issue using Signal, though a majority of my messaging is standard SMS unfortunately. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33386:	   Would love to use the app, but registration keeps on failing at the last step (failed to connect to server.) Tried everything I could think of, but problem persist. Any advice? 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33396:	  The application is light. It's a good alternative for Hangout. It is encrypted. The application need some serious improvement for SMS/MMS animated gif/large image. It's ridiculous that I can't send a regular gif through SMS/MMS but I can do it on any other messenger. Its hard to use the app for all conversations because MMS does not work properly as it is limited. PLEASE FIX AND REMOVE THE MMS LIMIT. ONCE FIXED 5/5 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33400:	   The notifications dont work quite right. I dont see anything on my lock screen or notification bar. No sound either. Just a quick vibration. I went in the settings and made sure everything is good. Galaxy note 4. Fix this and ill give 5 stars. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33406:	   Love this app. My only single problem is that I don't understand why image quality is scaled down to send. If you could change it to allow sending of the full size file/picture I will definitely give 5 stars! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33408:	   Still cannot receive MMS. Phone won't download, keep receiving error and unable to receive pictures. App is up to date, but there seems to be no fix. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33418:	   Only bummer is when others don't use it as well. Solid texting tool. It is as advertised. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33464:	   Only problem I'm having is if I have another app or window open, it doesn't alert that I have a text message. I have to open signal in order to get any kind of notification. Fix that and you get five stars. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33470:	   Does everything it's supposed to do. And does it seamlessly and without any issues, delays, or intrusion. Simply awesome. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33479:	   The first thing I do when I upgrade my phone is get Signal - never any weird problems for me. Simple; I see 1 mark if sent then 2 check marks showing me that it's been read. And decent notifications; my quiet "Ding" AND small blue flashing LED lets me be aware (LG Stylo2.) GREAT app! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33488:	   Good but when are you going to fix the invite friends double contacts bug? When having WhatsApp contacts you see them as double entries in the invite list. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33489:	   Simple to use and doesn't get in the way. I can recommend it to my nontechnical friends without having to worry about them getting frustrated with it. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33497:	   Simple easy to use, but has lagging issues delivering and receiving texts. I also wish I could adjust the font size. S4 KK444 Rooted AT&T ROM 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33522:	   Seemed like a great app, but impractical to use because you have to "wake it up" first before it delivers messages. Gave the update a try - same problem. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33526:	   I used to love this third party alternative to the less-than-stellar Android or Samsung messaging default until I realized people weren't getting my texts. Coworkers and private relationships have been tarnished because the texts I sent out never reached the intended recipient! This may be a sleek, fast and aesthetically-pleasing app but when it doesn't do it's primary job, there's no excuse for that. I'm not the only one who has had this issue with the app, from people on different carriers (I'm on Sprint) 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33533:	   Handful of people for which I consistently have issues receiving messages, but great and secure for 95% 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33535:	   Hi I tried to register through my WiFi connection and Vodafone network giving me same error that I can't and to check my firewall settings 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33536:	  Best messenger app and it enables secure messaging at the same time. I also love the voice messaging feature. I tried it about a year ago previously, and it didn't work that great. This time, everything has worked perfectly. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33541:	   I loved the layout and customization of the app and especially loved the fact that my private messages were, in fact, private. However, I had to switch back to my default messenger app, because too many of my messages were failing to send, I couldn't participate in group texts, the app would close when it was supposed to just minimize, and I couldn't send multimedia messages. Very unreliable. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33546:	   Seamlessly replaces your default texting application while protecting your privacy, But once you transfer your conversations into the app, there isn't a way to get them back out. It also limits each message to 160 characters and splits messages longer than that into pieces. Fails to download images sometimes. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33547:	   It's always telling me network failed every time I try to make a voice call 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33550:	   I used to love it, but as of a couple of days ago, the app went haywire and locked my phone up. Wouldn't let you reply or send text. Keyboard wouldn't work anymore, had to switch back to the standard messenger on my Moto Z Force. Locked keyboard on screen forcing me to restart my phone. Once the bug is fixed, I will use the app again. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33552:	   Also Cannot register in India, may be some kind of block by internet provider. Trust is very thin due to these factors. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33554:	  Problems loading pictures. Doesn't work on certain WiFi networks. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33558:	   Is a great option to be used as an sms app. But has the issue of some messages getting sent/delivered late. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33560:	  Clean and simple but sms not working is other person having signal is off network... 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33581:	   Good app but make sure you have App Optimisation turned off for it otherwise notifications don't work. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33593:	   Signal to Signal messaging is sorely lacking. A few days after my friend got signal, message delivery times went way up (sometimes several hours.) disabling Signal messaging fixed this. Would be 5 stars if not for the services delivery issues. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33598:	   Searching within the application is not working properly yet 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33613:	   I tried to sign up but no use , it's blocked completely in Oman. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33617:	   the calls is not working for me only chat 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33622:	  Great but a few bugs 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33644:	   The best program ever for messages and sms there is nothing so professional and all is free and cryptic fast never any problem such a good service thankyoy signal and it's creators. Susanna org reg 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33654:	  Please Help!!!!! it says connectivity error. signal was unable to connect to the server 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33679:	   Does a respectable job of providing all the functions of the other messenger apps, but without the privacy issues. Definitely recommended. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33680:	   This is easy to set up and use. And you can use the chrome app on your desktop, even if your phone is off. That's a lot better than WhatsApp. And it doesn't use your information in any way. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33688:	   Always failed during register. Got message saying unable to connect to server. Tried tens of attempts. Please make it work to register. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33691:	   Not sure but occasionally swipe writing does not go smoothly. Only the first letter of the word shows. If you tap on the letter, the rest of the word shows up. Can't reliably replicate the error. Maybe something I am doing. Otherwise, a great app. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33712:	   The primary reason to use this app is for the security and peace of mind that comes with it. Even if you aren't downloading this app for the security factor, you'll still be pleasantly surprised with how simple and elegant this messenger is. Signal gets a perfect score from me! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33717:	  It looks great, works well, and the encryption scheme is outstanding. FYI: it uses data rather than SMS to send messages. Per their blog, they could not get the level of security they needed using SMS so they switched. It's a very small amount of data, but that could be a deal breaker for some people. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33720:	   Easy to set up and use. Texts from other signal and regular sms are not shown for days. Bad quality of phone calls. Update: previously messages were delayed up to several days, now they don't arrive at all. I do like the program in itself, but it fails at its core function 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33729:	   What else you can ask for. Whatsapp and IMessage are not trustworthy enough because they are not open source. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33730:	   Tried with mobile data, wifi, none of the options worked, but I have perfect network in every other app, and there is no firewall or anything blocking the connection.. After clearing google play services cache and data it succeeded but at least the app should give a hint because it is a common bug and would be nice to have as a suggestion rather than me have to search for it. Other than this the app itself is really useful and well done. Cheers, Balint from Tresorit 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33745:	   I use an Android phone and that is completely secure, including not being able to screenshot messages. HOWEVER, if you message someone with an iPhone they can save and screenshot the messages all day long. I've got screenshots of texts within the signal app from an iPhone sent to me. Garbage!!! Fix that, I fix my rating. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33747:	   Every security source I can find cannot find anything wrong with this process... Whether it be the legal battles they fight or the implimitation of the program... Thank you for truly thinking about the users privacy. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33751:	   Due to the colors in the received messages, I have problems reading them. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33756:	   Hard to run a business when half my messages come in saying this instead of actually receiving anything. Fix this and I'll give a better rating. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33772:	   I have eeported this issue Three times since signal and it still hasn't been fixed 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33801:	   New update fixed all my issues on nexus 6P 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33808:	   Love the encryption, surprised by all the permissions needed, and I don't like how my notifications are so random. Most of the time, I only get them when I open the App. That is a problem as some of them have been time-critical and I can't sit opening the app constantly. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33826:	   Doesn't work 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33833:	   It's a great app to stay in touch with family and friends, and encryption is transparent. But voice calls are difficult up to impossible to follow, as volume is too low. Will give 5 stars once this is fixed. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33835:	   Frequently you do not get your messages in the due time and/or do not get notifications at all. If you open the app, then suddenly you receive all pending messages (yes, I allowed the app to notify me on every message I receive). This happens with all my contacts that use Signal. It would be interesting to send standard sms when the phone is not connected to the Internet, specially when you use Signal as your default sms/mms app. Nevertheless, it is an app with lots of potential. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33838:	   Love it, most of the time. I compared my installation on G5 Nougat against another user on older Android and mine is missing the Manual MMS settings in the menu. I fear this is why I have consistent difficulties in receiving group MMS. Very frustrating. I have reset the app, reset my APN, and this issue persists. I love the secure message features like setting msg expirations. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33859:	   Android 7.1.1. The recent blocking issue, and your rapid response is highly appreciated and commendable. Thank you. It just keeps evolving and is a primary tool for myself and my colleagues. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33870:	   Does not consistently send/receive messages often just fails. This app is not using the new app security model, meaning it needs a ton of access and cannot reliably have access to things such as location revoked without potentially breaking core functionality. The developer has added sticker support than modernizing the application for the Android users. Fluff features such as stickers should come after basic update functionality. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33874:	   Replaced without a problem the default sms 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33883:	   Especially for students who are challenged with publicity/paparazzi issues .. and those whose people would kill them if they knew. Sometimes, these are the same people. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33884:	   Also have people I'm sending messages to getting an error that my number has changed (or something like that, but nothing has changed). Overkill for day to day communication and not worth it if my messages aren't going through. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33902:	  Codicil fixity fit dickey focused bobbing custard hi hiccough fidgeted 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33903:	   Does the job: works well and I haven't had any problems 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33906:	   Not a single problem so far. Obviously, you'll need to disable GVoice integration if you use your carrier # for GVoice. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33928:	   I am now bout to give up on using it encrypted to an iPhone. Plus discovered a picture from iPhone contact being attached to another conversation. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. HELP. HOPEFULLY JUST MINE.IF NOT FIXED MY RATING DROPS. Love the generic encryption but wish it had more help in its use, especially the IOS Apple version has NO RESET. STRONGLY Suggest SETTINGS include a feedback option and a HELP system. I use Samsung Galaxy S5 and have no problem texting an iPhone. But Iphone owners need help badly. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33938:	   This is a secure, fast and light texting app. The delivery reports are not working correctly on Verizon SMS and just return with an error that every message was not sent (although they are sent fine). Will upgrade to 5 when and if that is corrected. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33950:	   This works as a standalone replacement for the SMS app on Android. I can even switch back to the built in SMS app without a problem. My requests: 1) add an archive feature, 2) include better default copy when inviting friends to Signal. Almost everyone thought it was spam. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33951:	   MMS is not working on the new version. It worked for me before. On HTC One with CyanogenMod 10. Will update review when fixed. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33960:	   I got the SMS with the code but the app says "SMS verification failed". I did not see any field to put it in. I guess the app is not allowed to read the SMS. The whole point of this app is privacy. Let me type it in myself. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33962:	   This app is now my go to. I've used previous versions and have always gone back to Google messenger because I preferred the aesthetic, but now I prefer the look and feel of this app. It's buttery smooth with very little bugs, and the reply from the notification window now shows your whole conversation, not just the last message sent to you. On top of that, it has some of the best encryption in the industry (as numerous tech articles will tell you. Although, encrypted conversions use data. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33966:	   Does what it's supposed to do, without crashing or losing messages like some others. You forget you're using an encrypted service which is exactly how it should be! It's also using good open source software that can be trusted, rather than relying on some random app developer for your privacy. Recommended! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33968:	   I've had so many problems with previous messages getting lost in progress or apps being really slow, I use a Galaxy S7 by the way, but Signal delivers (pun intended) in every way possible! Very fast, very pretty display, great quick reply, very reliable, and the security is a good bonus as well. I'd recommend it to everyone for these reasons, I honestly have no real problems with it, maybe it could use more setting options like Textra has, but that's really my only gripe. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#33995:	   My wife and I are testing signal out, using it for SMS as well as encrypted messages. Sometimes if one of us has a patchy internet connection then we don't receive messages until the sender connects to Wi-Fi (sometimes hours later). I would like there to be better feedback for the sender in these cases (who is often unaware that the message has not been received) & an easy option to send an (unencrypted) sms if a message does not deliver. Security is important but reliability and transparencyoften more so. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34006:	   It doesn't work between myself and my buddy over in the UK. This app consistently asked if it wants to be my default text messenger. I can not send privately locked messages to my buddy in the UK. Hopefully someone will fill this void because this app is a complete failure 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34012:	   It no longer crashes when you receive a multimedia message, but you also can't view them. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34015:	   Couldn't find how to choose through wich sim to send an SMS 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34018:	   After one hour of trying I gave up! After getting the sms code, when it has to verify it, I get a shitty error with "connectivity error" and "no network", even if both are OK and working!  Just tried again today! Same problems! Not working due to some "network error"! Tried both WiFi and mobile network! Still same problem today, 19 Dec 2016! Shame! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34022:	  Great app. Only problem is I'm not able to send a message to a number of recipients. Can this be sorted out? 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34031:	  Must not be compatible with my android phone because the "security " text sending isn't available. Deleted app because I believe it doesn't work. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34034:	   Issues when user changes devices, i get "bad encrypted message". Understandable if another party may be change devices using same id. But rather than blast the feed with same error. Handle it more elegantly. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34037:	  I installed Signal and started receiving strange telephone numbers so I have uninstalled it. I do not think that it does what they say that it does. You can't get help from a person only answers on forum...Sorry that it's not what I thought. Very limited. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34045:	   only real problem is the same for all the other similar apps. To use all the features you need the other users to also have this app. Makes for a good SMS app. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34051:	   Pretty good app, I like the security features but I am receiving duplicate text messages, sometimes days apart. After troubleshooting, it isn't my carrier but the app itself. Hopefully this minor bug gets sorted out. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34078:	   I love how it seamlessly replaces your default messaging app and comes bundled with automatic end to end encryption without any setup. The only downside is that more people don't use it! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34105:	   Great app for privacy but it occasionally misses a message or 2 from unsecured contacts and those messages get delivered to the default messaging app. Fix that and it's 5 stars all day. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34124:	   I love this and appreciate that Whisper developed this app so people can send texts securely. I do have one question though, am I doing something wrong or are pinger numbers not supported? I can send texts through pinger and receive calls, but I cannot send the texts with that number through signal. In fact I had to use the call verification because the SMS didn't work when I went in and attached my pinger number to Signal. Love the app though great job guys and gals. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34175:	   I can't even get this piece of crap to ever let me log-in! And I haven't been able to get any tech support for several months now. It can't get any lousier or more worthless than that! Its interface looks impressive, but if it won't let you ever log-in, and you can never get any help or tech support, then it is totally worthless. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34198:	   I find the text just perfect but they added stickers and gifs which I was very excited about but nearly all of them give me an error that they are to big to send... So what is the point of adding that option if you can't actually send them? Am I missing something? 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34218:	   Everything works as expected but every now and then a message will not go through. If that gets fixed I will change rating to 5 stars. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34221:	    on wifi without cell service. So I don't get signal at my house. Which is why I want to text through wifi on my number. Worked while I was in signal, but as soon as I lost service it stopped working. Can't attach the gifs offered says thier too big. Customize options are lacking. There are plenty of other apps that have better features. If it text over my wifi with my number it have got a higher rating. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34234:	   If possible I would like myself to decide whether to appear in notification panel or not. Could you fixed please 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34242:	   App is ok. Great for security and encryption, but lacking in emoji support and scheduling texts. Also has issues with MMS support. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34260:	   Does what it claims, and I like that they have been independently audited to ensure security. Minus one star because the pop-up message feature is buggy on my Nexus 6p and sometimes doesn't register input 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34266:	  Good stuff. But remember to manually export your messages from within the app, if doing (eg) ROM flashing which requires wiping your phone. Signal doesn't use the Android system messages DB, so a normal ADB Backup won't save them. I learnt this the hard way and lost a couple of hundred messages! This also applies when switching back to another SMS app. Any SMS you sent using Signal won't be imported back into the system messages DB, so if you need them, you'll have to manually export/import them. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34268:	   Doesn't get any better than this! 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34292:	   Works well. Very few bugs 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34302:	  The only major problem i have is that it messes up picture messages for me 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34304:	  I looked at the encryption code for every contact I messaged, and the code is the same even when I reset it... don't use this app 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34314:	   I get many random dropped calls on my Nexus 5x on a good connection. Then the app seems to crash after this happens and i can't make more calls. Also, it will sometimes lose a message draft for seemingly no reason. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34323:	   Works and is from what I can tell the most secure option. Would be great if it didn't use my contacts to build a network. Privacy consists of more than just securing the contents of communication. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34324:	   Simple and secure messaging, great! Only issue i encountered so far is that one friend of mine (iphone) won't get my signal msgs on her text app with mobile data disabled, only once shes back online - slightly anoying as it makes me switch messaging apps just to be able to text her. Any chance to solve this? 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34326:	   . Only issue I have found is that photos take a bit long to upload blue. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34349:	   Texts and links oK bur fails to send pics or I would give it 5 stars. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34351:	   I receive messages from others but when I try and send messages I get a notification that says message not sent and that an issue needs addressed but it doesnt tell me what the issue is. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34353:	   Edit: was a fine App until it stopped working entirely for SMS. - - - old review: End to end encryption everywhere should be a Standard. I wish gifs would work in Signal-to-Signal chats. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34357:	  Keeps reopening sometimes, please fix other than that great progress 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34360:	   Great amazing app.. Only draw back is it lacks a private box, scheduled messaging, a favourites tab, & resending failed text by simply tapping on it on notification bar. Improve on customization for individual contact messages, like whether to show message or just contact name on notification bar, customization for individual message bubbles, & the pop up, whether pop up for individual messages automatically closes or remains open after replying, automatic or no keyboard for individual message pop ups. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34378:	   I like the idea and encryption but I don't get notifications from other signal users. Their messages only show up when I open the app, so I never get them on time. Regular texts work fine, but that's not what I need it for. So unfortunately useless for me at the moment. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34379:	   So I was content with the app for a while and then started noticing that it was taking hours for messages to come through. This after using the original messaging app that comes on the S7 without issue. What's the sense of having an encrypted message when it takes four hours to get it. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34388:	   then it's a good app. though during testing it had some slight issues with sound quality, all i can say. Seems like a good app. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34393:	   While "I don't have anyting to hide" I hold our right to privacy and the ever growing illegal infringment on it as one of the most important issues of our time. I wanted to write to your team and say thank you so much for providing this valuable and powerful tool that essentially makes the statement as it should be said.."While I don't have anything to hide it's none of your business what I'm saying or doing!!" Again thank you so much and to the people who put in the many hours writing code thanks. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34411:	   Has bugs just like anything. Not for power users but does what it advertises. 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34419:	   Phone call over Bluetooth fails to end the call after it was finished 
org.thoughtcrime.securesms#34431:	   I'm trying to send a message to 8 people, it says "failed to send" and "not delivered" :-/
