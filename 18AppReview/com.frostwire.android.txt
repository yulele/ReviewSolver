com.frostwire.android#180277:	  It used to be good! Now i can't get any results for a song unless i type the artist by itself. If I type in the name of a song nothing, if i typed in the name of the artist and the song, nothing. Im only able to search the artist and then go hunt for the song and hopefully find it. I may be doing something wrong, im not sure, thank you for a overall good app! 
com.frostwire.android#180278:	  At first it worked great, but then when I switched over to Frostwire plus then I couldn't download anything, but crappy covers. It sucked, but the good thing was that it pulled all my musux from Google Play...I just wished it downloaded directly to google play. 
com.frostwire.android#180283:	  It keeps downloading random music files and deleting random songs that I ACTUALLY downloaded. Every day I have to re download about 5 songs and clear out about 30 that I didn't download. It's the most annoying thing ever. 
com.frostwire.android#180293:	  I would like to thank the customer service team for helping me figure out why I was having so many problems with the app. Everything seems to be back to normal and I have been able to find most of the music I've been looking for. 
com.frostwire.android#180297:	  FrostWire is like the best thing in the world is like I can download everything I want and then the updates when I did it it didn't stop all my downloads and I couldn't after that I couldn't download any more my videos or music and then and then all my FrostWire music when I did it it all deleted 
com.frostwire.android#180301:	  So bad don't download this music app because you have to log in 
com.frostwire.android#180304:	  I had to re-download beacase it stopped working. I am disappointed 
com.frostwire.android#180345:	  Doesn't load 
com.frostwire.android#180353:	  The new update has a lot of bugs. Can't download anything 
com.frostwire.android#180358:	  Works pretty well most of the time. But some times it just says error when I try downloading stuff 
com.frostwire.android#180373:	  Was the best download app I've had...WAS..Over three months I download a great play list from my youth then it decided to to just stop working. Couldn't find anything, including the tracks I has already downloaded and anything I manage to find downloads then comes up error movement incomplete. Reinstalled latest version, change the music player but still no joy. Nothing on the help page for these problems so I am a bit peeved as a can't find a download that anywhere as good as this was... as I say WAS .From 5 + stars to 1. 
com.frostwire.android#180377:	  I have not been able to download anything in about a month. You really need to fix this and fix it soon! 
com.frostwire.android#180384:	  It's not like the old frost wire where I could download a ton of classic rock for free and it's really sketchy, don't get this app if you're into classic rock and roll it sucks.

com.frostwire.android#180397:	  So I really like this app and find most of the songs I really like but I keep running into an issue where when I use it it creates around 500 fum titles that don't play anything. No music and its all titles from the artists I have downloaded ( not even specifically the songs). Please help 
com.frostwire.android#180435:	  Downloads are inaccurate and they don't download completely. The app freezes when I'm changing from tab to tab in the app. 
com.frostwire.android#180463:	  Used to be able to find music I was looking for. Now I can't find any! 
com.frostwire.android#180476:	  Finally a application that allows you to download full albums and it works really well after the fixes 
com.frostwire.android#180501:	  It's a good app I just have to uninstall then reinstall a few times a month Wich is BS... But if that was fixed it would be

com.frostwire.android#180726:	  When a app can't find any songs by Elvis Presley,then that app is as worthless as the stupid person that design it. 
com.frostwire.android#180731:	  Every single time I go to the search bar and type a song or artist it doesn't have any results? Its impossible for me to download music it worked so good for me before and all of a sudden I can't search Anything!!! Please fix!!!

com.frostwire.android#180904:	  This app is incredible!!! Ever since Limewire had problems in 2009-2010 with lawsuits and all this app emerged 2 years ago believe someone told me in 2014-2015. It has been so amazing and I am so glad that once again we have access to a free Downloader that is legal download and is protected to be going strong on the market. Thank you to the developers for bringing this!!! It seems like everyone was starting to lose hope after Limewire was found out to be terrible after hearing about their lawsuits for whatever reasons. My hope is that Frostwire continues for years to come!! I have been able to find my favorite artists most of them on that site. I am very well pleased!!! Job well done guys 5 out of 5!!! 
com.frostwire.android#180917:	  There is a lot of music I could not find and had to repeatedly find other sources. Question: if I were to delete the app will or delete the songs I have on my SD Card? 
com.frostwire.android#180918:	  Its okay except I can't download Mexican music 
com.frostwire.android#180924:	  Even after the update fixing the connection issues, it still won't download. Before all those happened, however, it worked perfectly fine.

com.frostwire.android#180941:	  Now most torrents will not download. Pretty frustrating. 
com.frostwire.android#180946:	  It literally sucks I can't find any music 
com.frostwire.android#180951:	  App sucks.. can't listen before you download and can't find what I'm looking for. Waste of space 
com.frostwire.android#180960:	  This was the 6th app I downloaded cuz the other ones sucked...I'm pretty happy with this one....haven't had problems yet.

com.frostwire.android#181029:	  Doesn't display results from TouTube anymore, leaving the search results pretty much obsolete. Also, opening this application is a real pain, because it won't actually close until I manually go to my settings and force stop the application. These were apparently fixed along time ago but not for me, at least. 
com.frostwire.android#181034:	  I sent a report to them and they fixed the problem within 24hrs.

com.frostwire.android#181060:	  Can't find all of my songs 
com.frostwire.android#181072:	  Literally the worst app i have ever seen, The smallest song list imaginable but when you finally do find a song it won't even attempt to download and just error if i could give it minus 5 stars i would, The type of app that will give you aids just using it 
com.frostwire.android#181082:	  Doesn't work I searched for Justin bieber and got one song wtf 
com.frostwire.android#181084:	  It is good, and it was what I wanted. The thing is that the app won't download anything that is above 8 mb. 
com.frostwire.android#181094:	  Can not download the artist 's you like 
com.frostwire.android#181095:	  Thank you for fixing the download lag/freezing, have you guys ever considered some sort of anti virus system that can possibly stop people from implanting viruses in their seeds? 
com.frostwire.android#181099:	  Please update the app. I've been with you since lime wire then frostwire. I've never had an issue. Please fix the torrent. Then will be 5 stars again..... All is back to normal. Thanks guys

com.frostwire.android#181526:	  There was a couple weeks where I couldn't download originals of most songs, only obscure mixes, covers etc. But frostwire fixed the bugs and it's working great again. I love this app. 
com.frostwire.android#181528:	  was working great. even though I still have the app it has deleted some of the files and now the app won't download anything. help !!! 
com.frostwire.android#181535:	  I listen to songs on Pandora that I look them up on this app and the app can't find the songs 
com.frostwire.android#181551:	  Wouldn't download ANYTHING!! 
com.frostwire.android#181554:	  Nothing works for me when I attempt to download. It shows that it is downloading, but no progress is made. Download speed stays at 0, so nothing ever gets downloaded. Uninstalled, because it does not work for me. 
com.frostwire.android#181560:	  Nothing will download. It says it's "downloading" but it doesn't download 
com.frostwire.android#181563:	  Won't download 
com.frostwire.android#181566:	  Could not find any songs. It would pull random artists when I would search for Lil yachty. Trash app don't waste your time. 
com.frostwire.android#181573:	  No download 
com.frostwire.android#181574:	  Won't download nothing it'll just fault out 
com.frostwire.android#181579:	  Used to love it, now it won't work. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it many times and it just stopped working. It says it's going to download songs that I can still find then never downloads. PLEASE FIX THIS!!! 
com.frostwire.android#181599:	  I used to really like this app, but lately, When I go to search for songs, I get nothing but SoundCloud versions. I want the original songs, not covers. Please fix this!!! 
com.frostwire.android#181605:	  It's not great. Can't find a single song I searched. Useless 
com.frostwire.android#181607:	  Ok I just put 5 stars to get to the top but I just searched something up but it's like in a different language/covers and I was like what?????? JUST DON'T DOWNLOAD EVEN THOUGH IT SHOWS SONGS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IT DOESN'T DOWNLOAD ONTO UR PHONE 
com.frostwire.android#181609:	  Started off fine but all of a sudden it won't download songs anymore. Waste of time. 
com.frostwire.android#181635:	  This app was amazing until the last update. Now I can't download any songs just music videos. Will rate 5 stars once this is fixed. 
com.frostwire.android#181640:	  Awesome app, and they have really cool swag for sale on their website, I was impressed with how fast I received the items I purchased! Just wish my downloads didn't end in errors so often. 
com.frostwire.android#181659:	  I'm just going to say I used to love this app. Since the new update I can't find any music I want. Just a lot of covers that sound horrible. What happened to being able to have the audience from YouTube videos? 
com.frostwire.android#181660:	  Okay guys so again I can't find songs I'm looking for and I know something is for sure wrong because I'm trying to find a song that I once had on this app! I keep getting results that aren't even relatively close this needs to be fixed. 
com.frostwire.android#181661:	  Trash doesn't load 
com.frostwire.android#181663:	  Nothing works now u can find music but it won't download anymore... Wtf 
com.frostwire.android#181666:	  S7 6.0.1 works perfect good job . To the people that complain that "it sucks" as a app dev people don't put their time in to making a app that doesn't work if you are having a problem ask the creator for help there are a lot of variables with all the different phones and s/w builds 
com.frostwire.android#181680:	  Can't find the songs I am looking for. Lots if ads. If you are looking for rnb music's not the app to use. 
com.frostwire.android#181681:	  The search bar I'd fuc**d fix or or else i will be pi$$ed 
com.frostwire.android#181686:	  Great when it works, but unfortunately that isn't very often. Most music I like isn't available on the app, and even if I did find an album, most times it wouldn't download properly anyway. Now, that would be okay with me, but instead of just deleting the broken files from my phone, it instead keeps them and makes them impossible to delete from my storage. I've got so many broken songs and files cluttering up my phone now, and I have no way to delete them because they're 'stuck' on my phone. Very, very infuriating, and it really makes my music selection untidy. Will not be using your app again. 
com.frostwire.android#181692:	  I can't download anything from YouTube or other sources for movies and music 
com.frostwire.android#181715:	  Doesn't work all the time 
com.frostwire.android#181725:	  I love it...just a little problem...for seeding...too slow...plsss...fix that... 
com.frostwire.android#181726:	  Initially it worked well. Could find most of what I looked for, although i had to weed through a zillion covers first. Unfortunately, I have to go through a thousand hoops to close the app. And now, there is nothing but covers. And, if I delete the app, I lose the music. So, yeah, it's good at first, but idk if it's really worth the hassle and memory it requires Response - whenever I click exit I MUST watch the ads that pop up or the app will not close. And, that is ONLY after I've done this at least 3X. Sometimes as many as 7X. So, when I am trying to conserve battery it is EXTREMELY irritating. I don't use an SD card. I have lots of storage on my phone, no need for it. Other apps download the music to my phone. This one doesn't even let me move the music over to my mp3 player. It's weird. And annoying. I'll look for an update, but idk if I want to open the app again. It takes sooooooooo long to shut it down 
com.frostwire.android#181748:	  Sometimes its work but sometimes doesn't work!what's the problem buffer can fix this problem a buffering situation.? 
com.frostwire.android#181760:	  it's really gay because you can't get the full song. I tried to get Caroline and it did not get the full song 
com.frostwire.android#181779:	  The songs will not download anymore. It used to work fine. Please reply and I will Rate 5 stars if problem is fixed 
com.frostwire.android#181801:	  Well I have this on my galaxy but now I have IPhone and I can't find the app on there 
com.frostwire.android#181828:	  Always been my to go to music downloader Only issue I have had with FrostWire is the fact that it can be misleading when purchasing the ad free version $5.95 for a year no in reality it's $5.95 for a year with the price of payment of that per month maybe fine print that a little better cause when I was receiving ads after first month payment I'm wondering wtf Other than that another thing is you guys could used a volume booster of sorts on your equalizer which doesn't really work well Also maybe when ppl download music you guys can find the cover art for the album's or tracks Food for thought I'm a Loyal Fan been team FrostWire for Years, just a couple of things to still iron out 
com.frostwire.android#181837:	  Worthless App, I couldn't download not even 1 song. 
com.frostwire.android#181871:	  CAN'T FIND ANY MUSIC WHATSOEVER SINCE LATEST UPDATE!!! FIX OR LOSE ALOT OF USERS!!! 
com.frostwire.android#181873:	  CAN'T FIND MUSIC SINCE NEW UPDATE 
com.frostwire.android#181878:	  Couldn't download crap 
com.frostwire.android#181892:	  Doesn't download 
com.frostwire.android#181895:	  Love it, but it gets annoying when you press exit, watch a commercial and it doesn't close, have to press exit again and see another commercial before it finally closes. Annoying. Please fix. 
com.frostwire.android#181909:	  Recently updated it, and now I don't get anymore YouTube links for songs, so I do not get the search results I used to get and won't let me get what I'm looking for 
com.frostwire.android#181913:	  If you unistalled it will erase all of the music you from it even if is your music library already it doesn't work anymore 
com.frostwire.android#181915:	  The best app of life. If I didn't download this then my life would be bad 
com.frostwire.android#181954:	  I just tried it,it doesn't work at all, garbage 
com.frostwire.android#181966:	  Can somebody answer me? This app is no longer working properly. Whoever is in charge of this app fix the damn problem already! 
com.frostwire.android#181974:	  won't find anything. woukd give it a minus rating if I could. 
com.frostwire.android#181981:	  I can't download music from YouTube. 
com.frostwire.android#181985:	  It always says error when I'm downloading a music. 
com.frostwire.android#181991:	  horrible kept crashing

com.frostwire.android#182010:	  i used to love this app because it worked perfectly fine on my Samsung 4, but i just bought my S6 Edge and it doesn't download anything anymore. please fix or something. 
com.frostwire.android#182012:	  Can't find song I'm looking for used whole title of track keeps receiving error try fewer words only typed 3 words I title I paid 6 bucks for no ads I expect to receive my money worth can't do that if can't find songs I'm looking for 
com.frostwire.android#182026:	  Didnt work. Couldn't find a single song, kept saying no matches. 
com.frostwire.android#182027:	  It is good app but it still some problems with it when I open other app then I check for download on frost wire the transfers page disappear for appearing it I have search again same movie I have to download again the page appears I hope fix this problem soon 
com.frostwire.android#182035:	  This app was great but since update it no longer works it won't download anything h811 LG G4 
com.frostwire.android#182037:	  Still not working. Program does not terminate. It still starts on reboot without notification. Deleted downloads start redownloading. What crap. Think you need new competent tech staff. Fire everyone. 
com.frostwire.android#182039:	  Worked one time, now will not download anything and doesnt have any of the music im looking for. Was honestly excited when it first worked as i cant seem to find a single downloader that works on my phone but like i said ive been waiting 2 days for one 40 MB file to download. Not even 1% yet. So overall pretty bad experience with this app. 
com.frostwire.android#182040:	  Easy to use...and actually free! There are several songs I can't find....but I am happy with this app! 
com.frostwire.android#182049:	  Can't find anything 
com.frostwire.android#182060:	  Did not work at all 
com.frostwire.android#182063:	  You guys need to fix the search engine. Everytime i try to look for a song on the music icon thingy it always says "use less keywords" and it only shows the downladable videos which is not what i need. I need music to download to my play list PLEASE FIX 
com.frostwire.android#182070:	  I can't find all the songs 
com.frostwire.android#182071:	  I can't get YouTube downloads anymore!!! What happened with this new update. I'll have no choice but to uninstall if this doesn't get fixed 
com.frostwire.android#182107:	  Phone started acting weird , after download , it kept showing it was active even after I would stop running it. So I just decided to delete It. had every song I looked for sadly it drained my battery within a hour. I don't recommend it. 
com.frostwire.android#182113:	  What ever happened recently...I dont know but now when you search a song you don't get a youtube version of it or at least one that isn't a video, but instead of getting that I get a bunch of fake songs that are not what I'm looking for. Please update and fix this 
com.frostwire.android#182120:	  The latest update screwed up the YouTube audio. I have frostwire plus. Please fix. This was by far the best music App 
com.frostwire.android#182121:	  I enjoy it haven't had any problems with it 
com.frostwire.android#182149:	  Found a song but someone Used it to bully someone will not use this app again until that is addressed 
com.frostwire.android#182160:	  Having issues downloading frostwire plus I did what it said and still don't give me music from youtube only SoundCloud 
com.frostwire.android#182162:	  Deserves a better rating. Can't really think of any issues that aren't worth the overall quality of Frostwire. 
com.frostwire.android#182203:	  I can't download half the songs I want 
com.frostwire.android#182208:	  I really really like it but after a download or two it just doesn't download anymore 
com.frostwire.android#182217:	  Fix the crashing issues 
com.frostwire.android#182219:	  Used to love this app you after reinstalling it it dont fine anything I put eminem in and it saying it dont recognised the name please fix and update please 
com.frostwire.android#182279:	  After I download something, The next thing I try to download won't work 
com.frostwire.android#182281:	  Don't find songs or artists that I'm looking for 
com.frostwire.android#182284:	  I have never had a problem with it 
com.frostwire.android#182286:	  Does not have everything I looked up some artists and couldn't find it and didn't have songs I was looking for . 
com.frostwire.android#182295:	  At first I loved this app. Found all the songs I wanted and more. Now that I recently reinstalled the app I am trying to download my songs again, but every download stops at "error" or the app force closes 
com.frostwire.android#182307:	  Can't find alot of artists I like mostly older songs 
com.frostwire.android#182311:	  It's great for downloading most songs but sometimes u can't find certain songs. 
com.frostwire.android#182320:	  So, basically I can only put in five letters to search. Y'know, there aren't a lot of songs with five letters in them. Y'knoe how hard that is? Don't download this. It's s waist of your time. 
com.frostwire.android#182337:	  I find the music I want...but it doesn't just download the individual songs, the entire albums download. And those songs do not play. I get an error message. That's something to fix. It maybe a P2P (great way to get music), but don't use up extra space with songs we don't want. 
com.frostwire.android#182340:	  There's a lot of ads and it crashes. But besides that I lost my phone and this is the best app to go to for right now until I can do something. But ya. It's good. I recommend it. 
com.frostwire.android#182342:	  Pretty good music downloader sometimes I can't find music I need 
com.frostwire.android#182347:	  you can't find much songs you want on there 
com.frostwire.android#182377:	  As long as you download anything but ogg and flacc you're good. Only a few songs I couldn't find 
com.frostwire.android#182379:	  Over all its a good app, I just can't find the songs I'm looking for from time to time. Or if it's a new song they most likely don't have it. But out of 10 songs I look for I will find 6. So it's an okay app. 
com.frostwire.android#182393:	  I can never find what I want. This app SUCKS! DO NOT DOWNLOAD! 
com.frostwire.android#182426:	  This app does not work I want to kill it it makes me so mad I want to throw my phone it is not a good app to use if you want to download music if you wanted to music I'd suggest download downloading any other because it's a piece of crap so if you want to download an app do not download this one I hate it you will hit it and everyone else when heated it makes you want to scream your head off and make sure I thought your phone so if you don't want to call your phone and cracked It or Break It I suggest not using this app is a piece of s*** Nick so you should go down there never a and guess what I'm sure anyone have to say this app is a piece of crap so because unless I say it because this is a bunch of my gosh so do not download it you can download it for a thought your phone but whatever goodbye I hate it so ok 
com.frostwire.android#182446:	  Can not find the songs or the artist I want to find. Do not waist your time with this app. 
com.frostwire.android#182485:	  No Download 
com.frostwire.android#182489:	  A lot of very popular songs I can't find on this 
com.frostwire.android#182505:	  Can't find one song I want that I can download 
com.frostwire.android#182516:	  I have Frostwire Plus, and have two issues. I have full service, but certain videos take a lot longer to download. Often kilobyte slow while others are a megabyte. Now the other issue. Last two Plus updates have added a lot of ads. I thought with Plus there were supposed to be fewer? 
com.frostwire.android#182533:	  Did not find any songs that were not popularized. 
com.frostwire.android#182544:	  Its really good has all the songs i want but it keeps crashing on me for some reason which really tickles your patience. Its good though 
com.frostwire.android#182562:	  Having some issues but still love it 
com.frostwire.android#182564:	  Good app been able to find almost all the songs I'm looking for. But does try to download more songs than I ask for. Needs to be tweaked just a bit more. I'd say maybe separate albums from single tracts. That way people don't get whole albums. 
com.frostwire.android#182588:	  It was awful I don't know what happened to it. It used to have all the selections you wanted, now it just random stuff that makes me wonder what even is this app. Don't download it just don't even waste storage space for this app 
com.frostwire.android#182592:	  Really the best app ever for free music, but about 75% of the music I search isn't there. So maybe a big song update? Also after downloading some songs you either find out they couldn't download or are not the right songs. A resolve to that would be being able to preview the song before downloading it. I would also give 5 stars if you fix it! Will forever use this app though as long as it keeps up. 
com.frostwire.android#182594:	  I love it but it freezes an wants me to find turents . I love this so much plz fix. 
com.frostwire.android#182608:	   Used to work great but can't download movies anymore =( 
com.frostwire.android#182641:	  I can download anything from music to some of my favorite movies I absolutely love it it deserves more than a 5 star rating easily. The ads aren't even a problem, even though you can pay to remove them for up to a year which is kinda dumb, but it isn't even needed 
com.frostwire.android#182666:	  It never works. Type in an artist, or song, and it says, "try fewer words". If it does miraculously download... during the finishing process it always says,,"error". It's a piece of JUNK APP! I keep it in hopes it will get better, but after a year, and a half of the successful downloads... It's still worthless! Update after update, and still to date...a TOTAL waste of space! 
com.frostwire.android#182668:	  Its good app some don't work but still good 
com.frostwire.android#182690:	  It's very good but u can't find all the new songs!! 
com.frostwire.android#182730:	  Please fix it 
com.frostwire.android#182752:	  It was good it just took too much space on my phone and it never stop running 
com.frostwire.android#182765:	  The app used to be great, but since updating there are quite a few bugs. Every single time I open the app, I have t agree to the terms and conditions. The app does not shut down when you hit the off button, and it usually just goes to an add when you tell it to shut down. The worst is every time I try to delete a song the app crashes leaving the song on the list. 
com.frostwire.android#182767:	  Its not working 
com.frostwire.android#182782:	  Can't find the songs looking for and they're new songs 
com.frostwire.android#182807:	  Some time the song I want is not working So it is three stars 
com.frostwire.android#182809:	  It sucks. You won't find what you're looking for. 
com.frostwire.android#182817:	   this a really cool app. but it is a bit too slow. Plz fix tht problem.... and in torrents, it shows tht fetching torrent and then, it takes way too much tym to fetch it. 
com.frostwire.android#182820:	  error moving incomplete message pops up on every song...waste of time 
com.frostwire.android#182824:	  Could not find all the songs I wanted 
com.frostwire.android#182827:	   But the songs won't download 
com.frostwire.android#182844:	  Tryed to be weaboo download song it no work as a weaboo im allmost a triggered as a feminsit 
com.frostwire.android#182855:	  It's O.K but sometimes it don't work 
com.frostwire.android#182857:	  I'm ok with the app, I just can't find one song 
com.frostwire.android#182871:	  I would rate five stars but on my device (ZTE Grand Max +) it's difficult to get the app to stop running. You click to exit then hit the button to stop it, it goes to an ad ya watch it then the ad closes and it's still running. I can't get it to stop running in the background, no music plays it just is constantly running. Other than that it's a great easy app for music. 
com.frostwire.android#182873:	  Was my favorite downloading app until the most recent update. Every thing I try to download automatically says error. I'm not the only one complaining about the same exact problem. Fix it 
com.frostwire.android#182881:	  It's pretty great actually. The only problem is when I download new music, I end up re-downloading my old music too 
com.frostwire.android#182882:	  This app is garbage!! Couldn't find one song I wanted and not user friendly at all... 
com.frostwire.android#182891:	  Not many songs. Takes long to load. Crashes alot. 
com.frostwire.android#182893:	  Search doesn't find anything I look up 
com.frostwire.android#182909:	  Coo but I didn't get all the songs I wanted 
com.frostwire.android#182914:	  This is the easily best music app! Very few ads, great selection of songs, and very easy to use. My only problem is that there's no way to sort your songs. But that won't stop me from giving 5 stars. It's infinitely better than every other app I've found. So pleased with this! 
com.frostwire.android#182922:	  Worst app ever .way to many ads and can't find Aerosmith really. This is stupid app 
com.frostwire.android#182933:	  3star cause conditions too slow,can't even play song before download & lagged.. fix this and make it improve abit.. 
com.frostwire.android#182934:	  Thanking Youuu Fixed it Apps store..... 
com.frostwire.android#182939:	  Slow can't find what I want 
com.frostwire.android#182945:	  Amazing app. If you know what your doing this will be one of your most valuable tools you have. One side note don't use this download large torrents on AT&T because they are tracking you. 
com.frostwire.android#182958:	  It's really good love it easy to find anything I need. Just keeps crashing so yeah 
com.frostwire.android#182998:	  Could not find song 
com.frostwire.android#183000:	   Didn't have music I searched. Music I did find didn't download. App looks complicated too. 
com.frostwire.android#183002:	  Disappointed that I can't find much updated music 
com.frostwire.android#183004:	  Good app but doesn't find most songs :-( 
com.frostwire.android#183008:	   It takes the songs off after I download a song. Please fix it 
com.frostwire.android#183013:	   But I can't find some of the music I like 
com.frostwire.android#183024:	   Some files are hard to get working, others are top notch. My biggest complaint is not having the menu for each file in the transfer section. There is supposed to be a way to clear a transfer (ie it's not working or its done) but it's not there for me. So I have downloaded a discography a couple times now because of it. It just keeps cycling. Very frustrating. 
com.frostwire.android#183052:	  I didn't find any of the songs i looked for! 
com.frostwire.android#183061:	   So many problems with this app. Not just the ads. Opens on its own and runs in the background even when you close it repeatedly. If you uninstall it the songs you download from it will no longer work. Many of the songs are labeled as if they are from an artist and then after you download it you find out it's just somebody's crappy cover of that song. 
com.frostwire.android#183064:	   Was a good app until they updated it now I can't use it at all it keeps asking for permission to see files and when I allow it it says something is wrong isn't worth re downloading 
com.frostwire.android#183069:	  Stupid it wouldn't load!! 
com.frostwire.android#183073:	   It need some new songs, can't find some, but it's awesome other than that! 
com.frostwire.android#183075:	   Actually not working.. 
com.frostwire.android#183077:	   I shouldn't even give you one star if your software can't find a popular artist that everyone knows, you seriously need to work on your product. 
com.frostwire.android#183081:	  Does not work 
com.frostwire.android#183085:	   It takes a long time to download and when it says that the finished downloads are not fully downloaded PLEASE FIX IT 
com.frostwire.android#183095:	   I must need an older version of this app because after the update it started pausing my downloads every few seconds. Driving me insane. Fix it and I'll change my rating. 
com.frostwire.android#183097:	   Sometimes I can't find the song I'd like but usually all it takes is to shut down the app and start it back up and then I can find it don't know why it helps lol but that's the only thing I can find that's kinda of an inconvenience 
com.frostwire.android#183122:	   Don't use 
com.frostwire.android#183127:	   This app gave me viruses do not get it! 
com.frostwire.android#183130:	   It's amazing, but I wouldn't say that it has EVERY song. I couldn't find at least 7 songs I've looked for, and surprisingly, they're all my favorite ones. 
com.frostwire.android#183141:	  DOSE NOT DOWNLOAD THE SONG I WANT!!! 
com.frostwire.android#183158:	   I'm able to find songs that I can't find in YouTube .. 5 stars 
com.frostwire.android#183164:	   The overall quality is amazing but they don't really have the music I'm into like twenty one pilots and ect. I'll give this 5 stars once it's fixed... 
com.frostwire.android#183166:	   then while I am downloading, it pauses the download by itself and there is no way for me to get it going again unless I force shut the app but then it does it again. I try to exit the app but it will just freeze it up and stay active. Lots of potential. Hope they fix it. Maybe it's because it's the Edge 7 and they haven't updated. I also have Frostwire Plus. 
com.frostwire.android#183167:	   before it was fantastic. today i tried to download but it will not respond. if it will, it takes time to open. then it will say it isnt responding. tried to uninstall and re-install it still the same problem. 
com.frostwire.android#183170:	   It doesnt let me download Hotel California by Tyga or the Gta V Radio Los Santos Soundtrack. Really love this app. Will give 5 stars when fixed 
com.frostwire.android#183172:	   Its no use 
com.frostwire.android#183188:	   This app was ok never good, go look up newer songs and doesn't know. Don't download this app not worth the time. 
com.frostwire.android#183193:	  loved this app but now when trying to download it says "error download incomplete" so can't get any songs 
com.frostwire.android#183196:	  I wish that they would let you get all of the same music as YouTube you can't find all the artist you want  
com.frostwire.android#183204:	   It doesn't even search properly... Waste of time... Don't download this crap! 
com.frostwire.android#183209:	   For a long time I have used frostwire plus and Youtube has worked fine, but now when I search ncs there are no results! Please fix! 
com.frostwire.android#183211:	    now. Can't find any of the artist or music I'm looking for. The upgrade seemed to let me down 
com.frostwire.android#183215:	   I usually never have problems with this app but every time I try to install the new update it says file can't be opened! Pixel Xl 
com.frostwire.android#183221:	   No matter what song selection I select to download, nothing downloads at all, either via wifi or mobile network. I have uninstalled/reinstalled, adjusted settings, cleared cache, nothing works so that I can download music. I've had this ongoing issue for 3 days now...never had ANY issues downloading before. I don't get any error messages just nothing will download. 
com.frostwire.android#183222:	   Sometimes things won't download on time and removing items sometimes leaves fragments. 
com.frostwire.android#183225:	   I've used frost wire for a wile now and have loved it and now even after updating the apk no more YouTube this is stupid none of the others work I'm sorry when you fix this I may use it agian but this isn't cool 
com.frostwire.android#183245:	   I had it for 5 minutes and all the searchs I did it couldn't find. All I wanted was too good by drake and it had nothing 
com.frostwire.android#183264:	   Didn't work gutted I'll try it again 
com.frostwire.android#183265:	   If I'm trying to download something it always crash,onetime my phone had a malware then I have to fix it and pay 918 because the malware is so hard to remove it has alot of viruses inside my phone. 
com.frostwire.android#183274:	  It's great but some songs won't download 
com.frostwire.android#183285:	   I have plus. Stil doesn't work. This sucks. 
com.frostwire.android#183294:	   It won't download anything. All it does is run your battery dead opening itself all the time. 
com.frostwire.android#183297:	   The only problem I have is why do I need to seed.. which ones to seed or not.. and why some artist or songs won't download buy says it did 
com.frostwire.android#183298:	   I DOWN LOADED FROSTWIRE AND MUSIC DOWNLOADER AND A POP UP CAME UP TELLING ME I HAD A VIRUS AND I HAD TO USE THEIR TOOL!! IT ALSO SAID MY BATTERY WAS DAMAGED!! IT'S A SCAM MY FRIEND DID IT AND CANNOT USE HIS TEXTS AT ALL!! **I DELETED BOTH** 
com.frostwire.android#183304:	   I really love this music downloader, but my music keeps deleting itself for no reason. Fix this!!! 
com.frostwire.android#183319:	   After you go over your monthly deal you can't download any more songs

com.frostwire.android#183373:	   DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS BUG RIDDLED CRAP. It downloaded hundreds of songs on its own.They were all unplayable. It took me hours to delete all the unplayable files this thing loaded. 
com.frostwire.android#183379:	  One problem they don't have Dj snake and Justin beiber let me love you zedd remix 
com.frostwire.android#183390:	   Some of it stop working or it doesn't search what I want it to 
com.frostwire.android#183393:	   Absolutely does what it says! I have downloaded every song that I have searched for, all original artists! I have also gotten more than I bargained for! Photos of the artist to my photo gallery, in addition I have downloaded entire CD's, like 29 songs!! You will not find a better app anywhere!! 
com.frostwire.android#183409:	   Idk if there is a problem with this app, but years ago I used to love it and find anything now I can't, I gotta use 2 other apps just to find music if frost wire can't find it. 
com.frostwire.android#183410:	  I like it but i cant find all the song i want can you please fix it thank you 
com.frostwire.android#183414:	   The only problem is that it puts the music on your phone before it's actually downloaded and sometimes you never finish the download and have to go in your phone and delete it! 
com.frostwire.android#183415:	  Takes to long. Deletes all my songs if i try to delete the app. Can't find a lot of the albums i like. Every time i try downloading songs back the go into my unknown artist and say 0:00 on time in the song 
com.frostwire.android#183419:	  Can't download all the songs I want but I grand majority can be downloaded 
com.frostwire.android#183435:	   Coming from a person who has delt with downloading music and couldn't because iPhone sucks. Frost wire is the best .. 
com.frostwire.android#183454:	  It doesn't have a lot of old school music or if you type too many words it won't work. 
com.frostwire.android#183508:	   there was an error the first time i tried it also 
com.frostwire.android#183509:	   I love this app, I can listen to and down all of my favorite songs. There's just one small bug where I can download additional instrumentals/songs on a Playlist although I have plenty of space on my external SD card. I've also tried deleting some songs and making a 2nd Playlist to add new songs too but the songs just download some songs I already downloaded. Can you please fix, this is the perfect  app just need a few adjustments. 
com.frostwire.android#183511:	   Then it just went to hell. Quit downloading torrents. Starts, but then constantly pauses downloads. HELP ME... Update01/07/17, still not working right, HELP FROSTWIRE! 
com.frostwire.android#183558:	   When I try to download music it doesn't and I try over and over again don't I mean DON'T download this app 
com.frostwire.android#183572:	   Never gives me a problem 
com.frostwire.android#183584:	  Didn't have anything I was looking for, and stuff that I tried wouldn't download because of no seeders 
com.frostwire.android#183620:	   fix the lagging and put more songs and out would get a 5 rating 
com.frostwire.android#183621:	  Is not downloading 
com.frostwire.android#183645:	  Its a great app and I found every song I wanted you can't find a lot of apps like this one 
com.frostwire.android#183648:	   I tried downloading music and i could only download an album for some reason it says its downloading and it just pauses the dowload even though its not paused by me!!! 
com.frostwire.android#183650:	   I downloaded this one after looking for hours. But it doesn't have a good selection of music so im going to try again and if I can't find what I need then im going to have to delete 
com.frostwire.android#183653:	  Can't download music I wanna listing to emo,Gothic,classical, and old school disco music 
com.frostwire.android#183688:	   I've used this app off and on for the past 4 years. I love the app and usually don't have any issues with finding music but can't find some newer music so I'll be app surfing for the time being I guess. "Disappointed" 
com.frostwire.android#183690:	  I use to like this app, but lately I cannot find any of the songs. Should never delete mp3 downloader that actually worked 
com.frostwire.android#183702:	   It was fine, great even. I used it when I needed to. Then it just stopped downloading. It won't download anything. I hope you can fix this. 
com.frostwire.android#183705:	   I have been experiencing a weird problem the last few days. I get on the app to do my thing and download music. I find my song and it downloads like normal, as soon as it gets to demuxing right after it will say error: moving incomplete. I would appreciate some kind of fix for this or someone tell me what to do please I'm in desperate need for new music. 
com.frostwire.android#183707:	   You can't preview the song before downloading so you just have to go with feeling, then it never explains what the other tabs are, and worst of all, when you download a specific song, it won't download it no matter what 
com.frostwire.android#183709:	   Some song I can't find but it worked great 
com.frostwire.android#183727:	   Ever since the update I'm downloading at 50kb a sec compared to 1mb plus speeds before the update. So now I have to delete, lose all my mp3s to get performance back with an older version. Fix this and ill give 5 star again. 
com.frostwire.android#183729:	   Can't find anything I search for. There's better apps out there. 
com.frostwire.android#183736:	  can't download anything.. 
com.frostwire.android#183738:	   I just downloaded n it's not opening n now my phone is hang n not working properly. Dustbin app. 
com.frostwire.android#183739:	   Never fails!!! 
com.frostwire.android#183745:	   When I downloading a song, it says "ERROR". PLS fix it. And pls add more popular songs 
com.frostwire.android#183752:	   Seems to not be working the same, I can't find any songs I'm looking for and on my old phone I had access to music from YouTube. This use to be my favorite app until it started doing this 
com.frostwire.android#183765:	   Hard to use if not use to it but really good to download many things at once 
com.frostwire.android#183776:	   Can't get no better 
com.frostwire.android#183777:	   It used to have errors when I try to download a song, but I'm not experiencing errors anymore. 
com.frostwire.android#183778:	   Can't find everything, that's why I only gave it 4 out 5 
com.frostwire.android#183788:	   The adds are annoying and it sometimes shows it hasn't completed a download. Sometimes it fails to download entirely. Also it doesnt have a great deal of Albums. But it does have quality songs if u can get through the drawbacks 
com.frostwire.android#183802:	   But yoi can't get all songs 
com.frostwire.android#183805:	  It would not let me play the songs before downloading them. I'm not downloading a song if I can't hear it first! ! 
com.frostwire.android#183807:	   Couldn't find anything I looked for 
com.frostwire.android#183808:	   I can't find the rest of the songs I downloaded. 
com.frostwire.android#183832:	   its that every time i look up a song, it takes a LONG time to show up/wont show results though the song is popular or i know its real/i can only have a short name or i wont get nothing. please fix. 
com.frostwire.android#183847:	   I love this app I use it for all my music but lately there's been a reduction of artist and songs that come up and I don't really like that to fix it that would be great 
com.frostwire.android#183855:	  Didn't work 
com.frostwire.android#183867:	   Your app is horrible and you can't find anything you want. Wish I could give you Zero stars. 
com.frostwire.android#183870:	   I have been trying to find a app like this for so long.It has every song you would like and other apps don't work as well as this one.So far this is the best application for music.Trust me anyone who is looking for a music downloader, Use this one. 
com.frostwire.android#183872:	   This "app" is just trash. Do not download. 
com.frostwire.android#183903:	  Its a good app now the bug are fix 
com.frostwire.android#183910:	  Doesn't work couldn't even press finish once I opened the app 
com.frostwire.android#183914:	  Great app has some small bugs But nothing worth complaing about 
com.frostwire.android#183915:	   Has every song I look up. Download time can be a bit slow, that's more on my carrier's end. But, I noticed that in the downloads list, Sometimes it'll move files to make room for new ones, and completely erase them from my phone storage. Not in the app or my music player. Fix this and this app is perfect. 
com.frostwire.android#183917:	  Doesn't work at all 
com.frostwire.android#183923:	  Can't find songs not even popular ones some come up but a lot don't 
com.frostwire.android#183924:	   Love it! And i love that if you are having problems they are super quick to help to solve any problems! Thank you Frost wire! 
com.frostwire.android#183927:	   DON'T GET IT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET SONGS 
com.frostwire.android#183929:	   Never fails ... needs better search options but the best app for getting the music you desire ... happy listening ! 
com.frostwire.android#183933:	   Seems to almost never fail me. All the songs I have 350+ are from frostwire 
com.frostwire.android#183937:	   Every song I tried to download in says "no results found try frostwire plus for more results" don't get it 
com.frostwire.android#183947:	   I absolutely love Frostwire on my computer, have used it for years. However, I don't understand why every time I have installed it on my phone (3-4x a year I try), no matter what, I get either no or very limited results. And searching for common/popular songs too. My phone works, 4G, WiFi... Why does the phone app not work but the desktop app does beautifully? 
com.frostwire.android#183955:	   Can't find right music 
com.frostwire.android#183956:	   The previous version I had had downloaded perfectly fine, but this newer update, when I try to download a file, it just sits there and doesn't do anything, the seeds stay at 0/0 and peers stay at about 0/3 or 0/5 and won't download at all 
com.frostwire.android#183960:	   I love this app. I have used it for years and only have a few issues sometimes.. otherwise love it 
com.frostwire.android#183963:	   When I can't download from other places, on Google Play, or any other 'providers' this I is a nice, preferred, and recommended app for everyone to use. 
com.frostwire.android#183970:	   Doesn't find anything 
com.frostwire.android#183972:	   Sucked ass soooooo bad coukd not get anyof the songs to pre play made me just download and they were CRAP and noooo where near what It was labeled as, poor audio quality couldn't find much songs then when did they were no even !!!! Eeek was sooooo ticked the time I waisted and data. Grerrrrr 
com.frostwire.android#183989:	   I don't like this app couldn't find what I wanted but I downloaded FrostWire plus from his website I found the music I wanted ! 
com.frostwire.android#183994:	   This app is dum it freezes and when I typed in the song I wanted it froze stupid app don't get 
com.frostwire.android#184000:	   Slow never worked I was concerned it was a scam defidently to not download 
com.frostwire.android#184005:	   Doesn't download the full song 
com.frostwire.android#184020:	   You can't download half of the songs it freezes and won't respond most of the time 
com.frostwire.android#184023:	   Every time I search a song, it either says search not found or error, or it even searches up something totally different. Good think tho is that I did find a few songs I couldn't find on other music downloading apps tho. 
com.frostwire.android#184054:	   It's the worst I've seen I can't download hardly no songs 
com.frostwire.android#184070:	   I dont know if its just my phone or what. I can download a few songs my issue is is that their not all by the original artist other than that I have no big big problems. 
com.frostwire.android#184075:	   It was fine on the first download but when I tried downloading more it wouldn't download at all. Didn't make any progress. I tried multiple different songs but it didn't download any of them 
com.frostwire.android#184080:	   Movies and TV don't download properly and it's always self-pausing. Only good for music. 
com.frostwire.android#184096:	  Sometimes it doesn't download the full album why? 
com.frostwire.android#184103:	   Solid app can find pretty much anything, but can be a little buggy. Occasionally it fails to download completely and if you pause a download it stops completely but for a free app it's pretty fantastic 
com.frostwire.android#184109:	   I honestly never have given a app 5 stars but frostwire absolutely deserves it. Almost every song I've searched has popped up. This app is amazing...until all my music deleted and now I can't find half of the music I had. Example: Hannah Montana, Micheal Jackson, and many others.. 
com.frostwire.android#184116:	  ._. I can't download enything ;-; 
com.frostwire.android#184176:	   Some of the songs I can't download 
com.frostwire.android#184185:	   I've had two phones because one phone I downloaded this app and it worked very well with the music.. But my phones back button wouldn't work because this app gave my phone a virus and it happened to my 2nd phone. You don't have to believe me, but this is my review of it. 
com.frostwire.android#184201:	   It doesnt download properly it start to downlaod then it stops have way thru the album whats the deal... Do i have to uninstall and install again or what... Will put a better review once the problem is resolved. 
com.frostwire.android#184214:	   This is the worst app I have ever downloaded. The people who created this should stop trying. What a bunch of bullshit. I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone. The song don't download & it's a pain in the ass to get it to shut down. Garbage 
com.frostwire.android#184218:	  It's not all that I can not find all the songs that I want and when I do find a song it tacks me to you tube 
com.frostwire.android#184249:	  I just got an email that they were fixing the bugs, but mine isn't fixed. Instead now it won't download ANYTHING! It just disappears a sec or 2 after I hit download. It HAS worked, but is usually very slow and confusing to find stuff. The labels are hard to understand. 
com.frostwire.android#184265:	   Can you believe it a free legal mp3 downloader with every song u can and every heard of plus downloads music video and instrumentalLYRICS TOO!!!!please don't download any other there almost fake mp3 downloader music player that just waste your time, energy and memory space. Believe DAT!!! 
com.frostwire.android#184277:	   Can't download song. There was not one song that I found. I tried six different artists over Thirty songs. My lookout program told me it has bugs. Waste of my time and yours. 
com.frostwire.android#184279:	   This app is sicking....always adding song to play list that you didn't download that the only thing I didn't like 
com.frostwire.android#184287:	   Worked once. Downloaded one song, it plays fine and downloaded quickly, tried another song, nothing, it stopped downloading songs after that. 
com.frostwire.android#184296:	   This is the only app that I could use that doesn't give me any problems. Great work! 
com.frostwire.android#184299:	   I use to really like this app. But now it sucks a** I will never use this app again. I would click on something to download and it wouldn't even show up in the transfers. Also if you uninstall the app whatever you download off the app gets deleted. That's is the dumbest thing ever. Another thing is that almost every song I try to download comes across as error. Y'all need to to fix this or just get rid of the app bc it really SUCKS. 
com.frostwire.android#184300:	   Everything goes to my music player that doesn't use WiFi so I can download music at home and listen to music without data on long road trips 
com.frostwire.android#184301:	   it's all good until u want to close the freaking app it take too LONG please fix it ASAP 
com.frostwire.android#184307:	   My dad had trouble with viruses on our pc's over the years but i love it for my phone no viruses its awesome 
com.frostwire.android#184316:	  Haven't had any problems only some has most of the songs I like 
com.frostwire.android#184321:	   One of my favorites too it's awesome accept you need to fix some stuff but otherwise it rocks 
com.frostwire.android#184322:	   Can't download something simple like maroon 5. Terrible. 
com.frostwire.android#184329:	   Most songs that come up in a search would not download, can't preview songs before download
